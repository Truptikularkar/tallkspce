Praise for
The Mindful Way through Depression

"Using mindfulness training to prevent and treat depression is a novel strategy
in the West, though it is a traditional application of Eastern meditation prac­
tice. Whether you struggle with depression or simply want to understand your
mind and emotions better, you will find this book accessible and useful. De­
pression is epidemic in our society, and I would love to see this sensible treat­
ment approach gain ground."
-Andrew Wei!, MD, author of 8 Weeks to Optimum
Health and Healthy Aging

"A revolutionary treatment approach. For depression sufferers, this book is a
truly useful guide to achieving emotional balance. For mental health profes­
sionals, it should be mandatory reading. I recommend this book and compan­
ion CD most highly."
-Daniel Goleman, PhD, author of Emotional Intelligence
"An invaluable resource not only for those who suffer from depression, but for
anyone familiar with the downward spiral of negative thinking and self-doubt.
The authors of this book explore the reasons for depression and give us guid­
ance and support, along with useful tools to find a way through it."
-Sharon Salzberg, author of The Force of Kindness
"If I could select one group of individuals for people to really pay attention to
when grappling with chronic unhappiness, I could not think of a better group
than these authors. Not only are they consummate scientists, but they are
each personally immersed in the moment-to-moment mindfulness that they
teach. This book brings together the contemplative practices of both science
and insight meditation in an effective fashion that is understandable to the or­
dinary person-no esoteric practice or mental health background is necessary.
Read it and see for yourself! "
-Marsha M. Linehan, PhD, Department of Psychology,
University of Washington

night that robs you of j oy, the unquiet mind that keeps you awake. It's
a noonday demon that only you can see, the darkness visible only
to you.
If you've picked up this book, chances are you know these meta­
phors are no exaggeration. Anyone who has been visited by depression
knows that it can cause debilitating anxiety, enormous personal dissat­
isfaction, and an empty feeling of despair. It can leave you feeling
hopeless, listless, and worn down by the pervasive j oylessness and dis­
appointment associated with longing for a happiness never tasted.
Any of us would do anything not to feel that way. Yet, ironically,
nothing we do seems to help . . . at least not for long. For the sad fact of
the matter is that once you have been depressed, it tends to return,
even if you have been feeling better for months. If this has happened to
you, or if you can't seem to find lasting happiness, you may end up
feeling that you are not good enough, that you are a failure. Your
thoughts may go round and round as you try to find a deeper meaning,
to understand once and for all why you feel so bad. If you can't come up
with a satisfactory answer, you might feel even more empty and des­
perate. Ultimately, you may become convinced that there is something
fundamentally wrong with you.

But what if there is nothing "wrong" with you at all?

Introduction
What if, like virtually everybody else who suffers repeatedly from

depression, you have become a victim of your own very sensible, even
heroic, efforts to free yourself-like someone pulled even deeper into
quicksand by the struggling intended to get you out ?
We wrote this book to help you understand how this happens and
what you can do about it, by sharing recent scientific discoveries that
have given us a radically new understanding of what feeds depression
or chronic unhappiness:
•

At the very earliest stages in which mood starts to spiral down­
ward, it is not the mood that does the damage, but how we react
to it.

•

Our habitual efforts to extricate ourselves, far from freeing us,
actually keep us locked in the pain we're trying to escape.

In other words, nothing we do when we start to go down seems to
help because trying to get rid of depression in the usual problem­
solving way, trying to "fix" what's "wrong" with us, j ust digs us in
deeper. The 3:00 A.M. obsessing over the state of our lives . . . the self­
criticism for our "weakness" when we feel ourselves slipping into sad­
ness . . . the desperate attempts to talk our hearts and bodies out of feel­
ing the way they do-all are mental gyrations that lead nowhere but
farther down. Anyone who has tossed and turned night after sleepless
night or been distracted from everything else in life by endless brood­
ing knows well how fruitless these efforts are. Yet we also know how
easy it is to get trapped in these habits of the mind.
In the following pages and in the accompanying CD we offer a se­
ries of practices that you can incorporate into your daily life to free you
from the mental habits that keep you mired in unhappiness. This pro­
gram, known as mindfulness-based cognitive therapy ( MBCT), brings
together the latest understandings of modem science and forms of
meditation that have been shown to be clinically effective within
mainstream medicine and psychology. The novel yet potent synthesis
of these different ways of knowing the mind and the body can help you
make a radical shift in your relationship to negative thoughts and feel-

ings. Through this shift, you can find a way to break out of the down­
ward spiral of mood so that it does not become depression. Our research
has shown that the program outlined in this book can cut the risk of relapse by

half in those who have had three or more episodes of depression .
The women and men who took part in our studies had all suffered
repeated bouts of clinical depression. But you don't have to have been
officially diagnosed with depression to derive significant benefit from
this book. Many people who suffer the hopelessness and pain associ­
ated with depression never seek professional help, but they still know
they've been imprisoned by a chronic unhappiness that subsumes large
stretches of their lives. If you've felt yourself repeatedly floundering in
the quicksand of despair, inertia, and sadness, our hope is that you will
discover in this book and the accompanying CD something of poten­
tially enormous value that can help you free yourself from the down­
ward pull of low mood and bring a robust and genuine happiness into
your life.
Exactly how you will experience the profoundly healthy shift in
your relationship to negative moods and what will unfold for you in its
aftermath are difficult to predict because they are different for every­
one. The only way anyone can really know what benefits such an ap­
proach offers is to suspend j udgment temporarily and engage in the
process wholeheartedly over an extended period of time-in this case
for eight weeks-and see what happens. This is exactly what we ask of
the participants in our programs. To deepen the process and make it
more real, we have included the accompanying CD that guides you
carefully and with precision in the meditative practices described in
the book.
Along with the meditative practices, we will be encouraging you
to experiment with cultivating attitudes of patience, compassion for
yourself, open-mindedness, and gentle persistence. These qualities can
aid in freeing you from the "gravitational pull" of depression by re­
minding you in key ways of what science has now shown: it is actually
okay to stop trying to solve the problem of feeling bad. In fact it is wise
because our habitual ways of solving problems almost invariably wind
up making things worse.

Introduction
As scientists and clinicians we came to a new understanding of

what is and what is not effective in dealing with repeated depression by
a somewhat circuitous route. Until the early 1 9 70s, scientists had con­
centrated on finding effective treatments for acute depression-for
that devastating first episode often triggered by a catastrophic event in
one's life. They found them in the form of antidepressant medications,
which remain enormously helpful in treating depression for many peo­
ple. Then came the discovery that depression, once treated, often
returns-and becomes more and more likely to recur the more often it
is experienced. This changed our entire concept of depression and
chronic unhappiness.
It turned out that antidepressant medications "fixed" depression,
but only as long as people kept taking them. When they stopped, de­
pression came back, even if not until months later. Neither patients
nor doctors liked the idea of anyone taking lifelong medicine to keep
the specter of depression from the door. So in the early 1 990s we
( Zindel Segal, Mark Williams, and John Teasdale ) started exploring
the possibility of developing an entirely new approach.
First, we set to work to discover what keeps depression coming
back: what makes the quicksand more treacherous with every encoun­
ter. It turns out that every time a person gets depressed, the connec­
tions in the brain between mood, thoughts, the body, and behavior get
stronger, making it easier for depression to be triggered again.
Next we started exploring what could be done about this ongoing
risk. We knew that a psychological treatment called cognitive therapy
had proven effective for acute depression and protected many people
against relapse. But no one knew for sure how it worked. We needed to
find out-not j ust out of theoretical interest but because the answer
had huge practical implications.
Until that time, all therapies, both antidepressant medication and
cognitive therapy, were prescribed to people only once they were al­
ready depressed. We reasoned that if we could identify the critical in­
gredient in cognitive therapy, we might be able to teach those skills to
people when they were well. Rather than waiting for the catastrophe of
the next episode to happen, we could, we hoped, train people to use

Introduction

these skills to nip it in the bud and prevent it from happening alto­
gether.
Curiously enough, our individual lines of research and inquiry ul­
timately led us to examine the clinical use of meditative practices ori­
ented toward cultivating a particular form of awareness, known as

mindfulness , which originated in the wisdom traditions of Asia. These
practices, which have been part of Buddhist culture for millennia, had
been honed and refined for use in a modern medical setting by Jon
Kabat-Zinn and his colleagues at the University of Massachusetts Med­
ical SchooL Dr. Kabat-Zinn had founded a stress-reduction program
there in 1 979, now known as MBSR, or mindfulness-based stress reduc­

tion , which is anchored in mindfulness meditation practices and their
applications to stress, pain, and chronic illness. Mindfulness could also
be described as "heartfulness" because it is really about a compassionate
awareness. MBSR has proved to be enormously empowering for pa­
tients with chronic diseases and debilitating conditions, as well as for
psychological problems such as anxiety and panic. These benefits could
be seen not only in changes in the way people felt, thought, and be­
haved, but also in changes in the patterns of brain activity that we
know underlie negative emotions.
Despite some initial skepticism about what our colleagues and pa­
tients might say if we suggested we were considering meditation as a
preventive approach to depression, we decided to take a closer look.
We soon discovered that the combination of Western cognitive sci­
ence and Eastern practices was j ust what is needed to break the cycle of
recurrent depression, in which we tend to go over and over what went
wrong or how things are not the way we want them to be.
When depression starts to pull us down, we often react, for very
understandable reasons, by trying to get rid of our feelings by suppress­
ing them or by trying to think our way out of them. In the process we
dredge up past regrets and conj ure up future worries. In our heads, we
try out this solution and that solution, and it doesn't take long for us to
start feeling bad for failing to come up with a way to alleviate the pain­
ful emotions we're feeling. We get lost in comparisons of where we are
versus where we want to be, soon living almost entirely in our heads.

6

Introduction

We become preoccupied. We lose touch with the world, with the peo­
ple around us, even with those we most love and those who most love
us. We deny ourselves the rich input of the full experience of living. It's
no wonder that we get discouraged and may wind up feeling that there
is nothing we can do. But this is exactly where compassionate medita­
tive awareness can play a huge role.

HO W TO MA KE THE B ES T US E OF THIS BOO K

The mindfulness practices taught in this book can help you take a
wholly different approach to the endless cycles of mental strategizing
that increase your risk of getting depressed. In fact, they can help you
disengage from this entire pattern of mental activity. Cultivating
mindfulness can help you let go both of past regrets and worries about
the future. It increases mental flexibility so that new options open up
to you when the moment before you may have felt there was nothing
you could do. The practice of mindfulness can prevent the normal un­
happiness we all experience from spiraling down into depression. It
does so by helping us get back in touch with the full range of our inner
and outer resources for learning, growing, and healing, resources we
may not even believe we have.
One vital inner resource we often ignore or take completely for
granted, whether depressed or not, is the body itself. When we get lost
in our thoughts and try to j ettison our feelings, we pay very little atten­
tion to the physical sensations from our bodies. Yet those sensations
within the body give us immediate feedback about what's going on in
our emotional and mental state. They can give us valuable information
in our quest to free ourselves from depression, and focusing on them
not only keeps us out of the mental trap of leaning into the future or
getting stuck in the past but can also transform the emotion itself. Part
I of this book examines how the mind, body, and emotions work to­
gether to compound and sustain depression and what this view emerg­
ing from cutting-edge research tells us about how to break out of this
vicious cycle. It brings into sharp relief how we are all prey to habit-

Introduction

driven pattems-of thinking, feeling, and doing-that curtail the j oy
inherent in living and our sense of possibilities. It makes the case that
there is an unsuspected power in inhabiting the moment you're living
in right now with full awareness.
Logic and the knowledge of the latest research findings can be
persuasive, but they are not necessarily of practical use in and of them­
selves, in part because they tend to speak only to the head through
thought and reasoning. So Part II invites you to experience for yourself
what any of us may be missing when we get totally caught up and lost
in our mental gyrations, aimed at "fixing" our state of unhappiness, and
lose touch with other aspects of our being and our intelligence, includ­
ing the power of mindfulness. At this point it may be j ust an abstrac­
tion, another concept, to contemplate what it might mean to cultivate
mindfulness of your own mind, body, and emotions. That is why this
section is designed to help you develop your own practice of mindful­
ness and see for yourself how profoundly transforming and liberating it
may be.
Part III will help you refine your practice and bring it to bear on
the negative thoughts, feelings, physical sensations, and behaviors that
come together to create the spiral that can change unhappiness into
depression.
Part IV brings everything together into one unified strategy for
living more fully and more effectively in the face of all of life's chal­
lenges and, in particular, the specter of recurrent depression. We share
stories of people who have grown and changed by engaging in the
mindfulness practices in the face of their histories of depression, and
we offer a systematic and easy-to-implement eight-week program for
putting together all the elements and practices described in the book
in a practical way. It is our hope that reading the book and engaging in
the practices themselves will put you in touch with your inherent ca­
pacity for both wisdom and healing in the most practical and doable of
ways.
There are multiple ways to derive benefit from this approach.
There is no need to commit yourself right off the bat to doing the
whole eight-week program, although the benefits of doing so could be

8

Introduction

enormous when the time is right for that kind of commitment. In fact,
you don't even have to have a specific problem with depression to ben­
efit profoundly from engaging in one or more of the mindfulness prac­
tices described here. The habitual and automatic patterns of mind we
will be examining afflict virtually all of us until we learn to come to
grips with them. You may want simply to learn more about your mind
and your interior emotional landscape. Or, in doing so, you may be nat­
urally drawn by your own curiosity to experiment with some of the
mindfulness practices, perhaps starting with those in Part II. This, in
tum, may motivate you to launch yourself wholeheartedly into the 8week program and see what happens.
Two words of caution before we go further. First, the various medita­

tive practices that we describe often take some time to reveal their full poten­
tial. That is why they are called "practices." They require revisiting, re­
turning to them over and over again with a spirit of openness and
curiosity rather than forcing some outcome that you feel is important
to j ustify your investment of time and energy. This is really a new kind
of learning for most of us, but one that is well worth experimenting
with. Everything we cover here is meant to support you in your efforts.

Second, it may be wise not to undertake the entire program while in the
midst of an episode of clinical depression . Current evidence suggests that
it may be prudent to wait until you have gotten the necessary help in
climbing out of the depths and are able to approach this new way of
working with your thoughts and feelings, with your mind and spirit un­
burdened by the crushing weight of acute depression.
Whatever your starting point, we encourage you to practice the
exercises and meditations described here and on the CD with a combi­
nation of patience, self-compassion, persistence, and open-mindedness.
We invite you to let go of the tendency we all have to try to force
things to be a certain way and instead work with allowing them to be
as they actually already are in each moment. As best you can, simply
trust in your fundamental capacity for learning, growing, and healing
as we go along through this process-and engage in the practices as if
your life depended on them, which in many ways, literally and meta­
phorically, it surely does. The rest takes care of itself.

"Oh No, Here I Go Again"
Why Unhappiness Won't Let Go

A L I C E T O S S E D A N D T U R N E D. S H E C O U L D N 'T S L E E P.

It was 3:00 in the morning, and she'd awakened with a j olt two hours
earlier, her mind instantly buzzing with a rerun of the afternoon meet­
ing with her supervisor. This time, though, there was a commentator. It
was her own voice , chiding her with shrill questions:
"Why did I have to put it that way ? I sounded like an idiot.
What did he mean by 'satisfactory'-okay, but not nearly
good enough for a raise ? Kristin's department ? What do they
have to do with the proj ect ? That's my territory . . . at least
for now. Is that what he meant by evaluating how things go ?
He's planning to put someone else in charge, isn't he ? I knew
my work wasn't good enough-not for a raise and maybe not
even to keep my j ob. If only I'd seen it coming . . . .

"

Alice couldn't get back to sleep. By the time her alarm went off,
her thoughts had moved on, from the hopelessness of her position at
work to the dire straits she and the children would be in once she was
out looking for a j ob again. As she wrenched her aching body out of
bed and struggled toward the bathroom, she was already picturing her­
self being rej ected by one new prospective employer after another.

11

12

M I N D, B ODY, A N D E M O T I O N

" I can't blame them. I j ust can't understand why I feel so down
so often. Why do I get so overwhelmed by everything? Every­
one else seems to manage fine. I obviously don't have what it
takes to cope with both a j ob and a home. What was it that
he said about me ?"
The tape loop in her head started over again.
Jim hadn't had any trouble sleeping. In fact, he j ust seemed to
have a hard time being awake. There he was again, sitting in his car in
the office parking lot, feeling the sheer weight of the day pinning him
to his seat. His whole body felt leaden. It was all he could do j ust to un­
latch his seat belt. And still he sat, immobile, stuck, unable to grab the
door handle and j ust go to work.
Maybe if he mentally ran through his schedule for the day . . . that
always got him moving, started the ball rolling. But not today. Every
appointment, every meeting, each phone call he had to return made
him swallow what felt like an iron ball, and, with each swallow, his
mind wandered away from the day's agenda to the nagging question
that seemed to be with him every morning:
"Why do I feel so bad ? I've got everything most men could ask
for-a loving wife, great kids, a secure j ob, a nice house . . . .
What's wrong with me ? Why can't I pull myself together?
And why is it always this way ? Wendy and the kids are sick to
death of my feeling sorry for myself. They are not going to be
able to put up with me much longer. If I could figure it out,
things would be different. If I knew why I felt so rotten, I
know I could solve the problem and j ust get on with life like
everyone else. This is really stupid."
Alice and Jim j ust want to be happy. Alice will tell you she's had
good times in her life. But they never seem to last. Something sends
her into a tailspin, and events she would have shaken off when younger
now seem to plunge her into despair before she knows what's hit her.
J im says he's had good times too--b ut he tends to describe them as pe-

riods marked more by the absence of pain than by the presence of j oy.
He has no idea what makes the dull ache recede or return. All he
knows is that he can't put his finger on the last time he spent an eve­
ning laughing and j oking with family or friends.
As visions of being unemployed swirl through Alice's head, a deep
fear of being unable to do what she needs to do for herself and her kids
lurks around the edges of her mind. Not again , she thinks with a sigh.
She remembers well what happened when she found out that Burt had
been cheating on her and she kicked him out of the house. Naturally,
Alice had felt sad and angry, but also humiliated by the way he had
treated her. He had been unfaithful. She had wound up feeling that she
had "lost" her battle to save the relationship. Then she felt trapped by
her circumstances as a single mother. At first she had put up a good
front for the sake of the children. Everyone was supportive, but there
came a point when she thought that she should be over it by now. She
couldn't continue to ask for help from family and friends. Four months
later, she found herself feeling more and more tearful and depressed,
losing interest in the children's choir she directed, unable to concen­
trate at work, and feeling guilty about what a "bad mother" she was.
She couldn't sleep, she was eating "constantly," and eventually she
went to her family physician, who diagnosed depression.
Alice's doctor prescribed an antidepressant, which made a big im­
provement in her mood. Within a couple of months she was back to
her normal self-until nine months later, when she totaled her new car
in an accident. She couldn't shake the feeling that she'd narrowly es­
caped death, even though she'd walked away with j ust a few bruises.
She found herself repeatedly reviewing the accident, asking herself
how she could possibly have been so reckless, how she could have ex­
posed herself to a risk that might have robbed her kids of the only real
parent they now had. As the dark thoughts got louder, she called her
doctor for another prescription, and soon she felt better again. This
pattern repeated itself a few more times over the next five years. Every
time she noticed the signs of being pulled down into the vortex again,
she felt increasing dread. Alice wasn't sure she could take it anymore.
J im had never been diagnosed with depression-he had never

14

M I N D, B ODY, A N D E M O T I O N

even talked to his doctor about his bleak frame of mind or his persis­
tently low moods. He was surviving, and everything in his life was fine;
what right did he have to complain about it to anyone ? He would j ust
sit there in his car until something came to him that would move him
to open that door and get going. He tried thinking about his garden
and all the beautiful new tulips that would be sprouting up soon, but
that j ust reminded him that he hadn't really done the fall cleanup ade­
quately and he'd have a lot to do to get the yard ready now, a thought
that exhausted him. He thought about his kids and his wife, but the
idea of trying to participate in dinner conversation that night j ust
made him want to go to bed early, as he had last night. He had planned
to get up early to finish what he'd left on his desk yesterday, but he j ust
couldn't seem to wake up. Maybe he would j ust stay at the office till he
finished the thing once and for all, even if he had to be there till mid­
night . .. .
Alice has recurrent maj or depressive disorder. J im may suffer from
dysthymia, a sort of low-grade depression that is more a chronic state
than an acute condition. The diagnosis doesn't matter that much. The
problem for Alice and Jim and many of the rest of us is that we want
desperately to be happy but have no idea how to get there. Why do
some of us end up feeling so low over and over? Why do some of us feel
as if we're never really happy but j ust dragging ourselves through life,
chronically down and discontented, tired and listless, with little inter­
est in the things that used to give us pleasure and make life worth­
while ?
For most of us, depression starts as a reaction to a tragedy or rever­
sal in life. The events that are particularly likely to produce depression
are losses, humiliations, and defeats that leave us feeling trapped by our
circumstances. Alice became depressed following the loss of her long­
term relationship with Burt. At first she was fueled by righteous indig­
nation and tackled single-parenthood with a vengeance. But it was all
she could do to take care of things on the home front when she re­
turned from work at night, so she gave up postwork get-togethers with
friends, dinner with her mother, and even phone calls to her sister in a

Why Unhappiness Won't Let Go

15

nearby state. Soon she felt weighed down by loneliness, crushed by a
constant sense of abandonment.
For J im, the loss was a little more subtle and a lot less visible to the
outside world. A few months after he received a promotion at his con­
sulting firm, J im found he no longer had time to spend with friends and
had to drop out of his gardening club because he was staying later and
later at the office. He also realized he didn't actually enj oy his new su­
pervisory role. Eventually he asked to return to a j ob similar to the one
he had done before. The change was a relief, and no one knew Jim
wasn't happy-not even J im at first. But he started getting spacey and
seemed often distracted. In his head, J im was second-guessing his deci­
sion, overanalyzing every brief interaction with his bosses, and ulti­
mately chiding himself over and over for having "failed" his company
and himself. He said nothing and tried to ignore these thoughts, but
over the next five years he withdrew more and more, had a lot of minor
health complaints, and, in the words of his wife, "just wasn't the man I
used to know."
Loss is an unavoidable part of the human condition. Most of us
find life an enormous struggle after the sort of crisis that Alice went
through, and many of us feel diminished by disappointments in our­
selves or others, as Jim did. But embedded in Alice's and J im's stories
are clues to why only some of us suffer lasting effects from such difficult
experiences.

WHEN UNHAPPINESS TURNS INTO DEPRESS IO N
... AND DEPRESS IO N WO N ' T GO AWAY

Depression is a huge burden affecting millions today and becoming
more common in Western countries, as well as in developing countries
that are "Westernizing" their economies. Forty years ago depression
struck people first, on average, in their 40s and 50s; today it's their mid20s. Other statistics in the box on page 16 show the scope of the prob­
lem today, but none may be more alarming than the data showing that

16

M I N D, B ODY, A N D E M O T I O N

depression tends to return. At least fifty percent of those experiencing
depression find that it comes back, despite the fact that they appeared
to have made a full recovery. After a second or third episode, the risk of
recurrence rises to between eighty and ninety percent. People who first
became depressed before they were twenty years of age are at particu­
larly high risk for becoming depressed again. What's going on here ? As
psychologists who had been involved in treating and researching de­
pression for many years, three of us (Mark Williams, Zindel Segal, and
John Teasdale ) wanted to find out. The rest of this chapter, plus Chap­
ter 2, explains what science has learned about the nature of depression
and unhappiness and how that knowledge, once we banded together
with our fourth author (Jon Kabat-Zinn) , ultimately produced the
treatment on which this book is based.
One of the most critical facts we learned was that there is a differ­
ence between those of us who have experienced an episode of depres­
sion and those who have not: depression forges a connection in the brain

between sad mood and negative thoughts , so that even normal sadness can

reawaken major negative thoughts . This insight added a new dimension
to our understanding of how depression works. Decades ago pioneering
scientists like Aaron Beck had the insight that negative thoughts play
a leading role in depression. Beck and his colleagues made a huge leap
in our understanding of depression when they found that mood was
strongly shaped by thoughts-that it wasn't necessarily events them­
selves that drove our emotions but our beliefs about or interpretations
of those events. Now we know there is much more to the story. Not
only can thoughts affect mood, but in those of us who get depressed,
mood can affect thoughts in ways that can then make an already low
mood even lower. It doesn't require a traumatic loss for those of us who
are vulnerable to plunge down into the spiral again; even the kinds of
everyday difficulties that many people shrug off can start the descent
into depression or perpetuate unhappiness from day to day. Even more,
as we'll see, this connection becomes so ingrained that sometimes the
negative thoughts that lead to depression can be triggered by sadness so
fleeting or minimal that the person experiencing it is hardly aware of
it.

No wonder so many of us feel we can't pull ourselves out of the abyss ,
no matter how hard we try. We have no idea where the descent began .
Unfortunately, our valiant efforts to figure out how we got where
we are tum out to be part of a complicated mechanism by which we get
dragged down even farther. The way in which our efforts to understand
ourselves can lead to additional problems instead of solutions is a com­
plex story. It starts with a fundamental knowledge of the anatomy of
depression and of its four key dimensions: feelings, thoughts, body sen­
sations, and behaviors, through which we respond to the events of life.
Key to this understanding is how these different dimensions interact.

THE ANATOMY OF DEP RESS IO N

Let's look briefly at the development of the whole pattern of depression
before we get into its individual elements.
When we become deeply unhappy or depressed, an avalanche of

18

M I N D, B ODY, A N D E M O T I O N

feelings, thoughts, physical sensations, and behaviors comes into play,
as revealed in the checklist of the hallmark symptoms of maj or depres­
sion ( see box, p. 1 9 ) The huge emotional upheaval that can come from
experiencing loss, separation, rej ection, or any reversal that brings a
sense of humiliation or defeat is normal. Disturbing emotions are an
important part of life. They signal to us and to others that we are se­
verely distressed, that something untoward has happened in our lives.
But sadness can give way to depression when the sadness turns into
endemically harsh negative thoughts and feelings. This morass of nega­
tive thinking then generates tension, aches, pains, fatigue, and turmoil.
These, in tum, feed more negative thinking; the depression gets worse
and worse and, with it, the hurt. We only compound our feelings of de­
pletion if we deal with them by giving up activities that normally nour­
ish us, like getting together with friends and family who might be a real
support for us. Our exhaustion is compounded if we deal with it by sim­
ply working harder.
It's not difficult to see how feelings, thoughts, physical sensations,
and behaviors are all part of depression. Earlier in this chapter we de­
scribed the aches that Alice felt after a night of berating herself, the
"iron ball" that J im felt like he had to keep swallowing when he
thought about what his day held in store. As many of us are only too
aware, being "down" can make it hard to do much of anything or to
make choices that get us where we want to go. What's harder to see is
how any one part of this anatomy can trigger the downward spiral and
then how each component feeds into and reinforces the others. By this
process the state of mind that keeps us unhappy or leaves us vulnerable
to depression gets stronger and stronger. A closer look at the parts at
this point may help us see the whole more clearly.

Feelings
If you think back to the last time you began to feel unhappy and de­
scribe your feelings, many different words might come to mind: sad,
blue, downhearted, miserable, despondent, low, feeling sorry for your­
self. The strength of such feelings can vary; for example, we can feel

Why Unhappiness Won't Let Go

19

Major Depression
Major depression is diag nosed when someone experiences either of the
first two symptoms in the fol lowi ng list, and at least fou r or more of the
other symptoms, continuously over at least a two-week period and i n a
way that departs from normal functioning .
1 . Feeling dep ressed or sad most of the day
2. Loss of i nterest or abil ity to derive pleasure from a l l or nearly a l l activi­
ties that were previously enjoyed
3. Significant weight loss when not d ieti ng, or weig ht gain, or a decrease
or i ncrease i n appetite nearly every day
4. Difficu lty sleeping th rough the night or the need for more sleep d u ring
the day
5 . N oticea bly slowed down or ag itated th roughout the day
6. Feeling fatigued or a loss of energy nea rly every day
7. Feelings of worthlessness or extreme or inappropriate g u ilt
8. Difficu lties with concentration or the a b i l ity to think, which can also be
seen by othe rs as i ndecisiveness
9 . Recu rrent thoug hts of death or ideas a bout suicide (with or without a
specific plan for com m itti ng suicide) or a suicide attempt

anywhere from slightly sad to extremely sad. It's normal for emotions to
come and go, but it is rare for such depressive feelings to occur by
themselves. They often cluster with anxiety and fear, anger and irrita­
bility, hopelessness and despair. Irritability is a particularly common
symptom of depression; when down, we may feel impatient, at the end
of our rope with many of the people in our lives. We may be more
prone than usual to angry outbursts. For some, especially young people,
irritability is a more prominent experience than sadness in depression.

The feelings by which we generally define depression are
usually thought of as an end point. We're depressed; we
feel sad, low, blue, miserable, despondent, desperate. But
they're also a starting point: research has shown that the

20

M I N D, B ODY, A N D E M O T I O N

more we've been depressed in the past, the more sad
mood will also bring with it feelings of low self-esteem and
self-blame. Not only do we feel sad, we may also feel like
failures, useless, unlovable, losers. These feelings trigger
powerful self-critical thoughts: we turn on ourselves,
perhaps berating ourselves for the emotion we are
experiencing: This is dumb, why can't I just get over this

and move on? And, of course, thinking this way just drags
us down further.

Such self-critical thoughts are extremely powerful and potentially
toxic. Like our feelings, they can be both an end point and a starting
point of depression.

Thoughts
Take a moment or two to imagine the following scene as vividly as pos­
sible. Taking your time, note, as best you can, what goes through your
mind:

You are walking along a familiar street . . . . You see someone you
know on the other side of the street . . . . You smile and wave . .
The person makes no response . . . just doesn't seem to notice you .
walks right past without any sign of recognizing your existence .
•
•

How does this make you feel?
What thoughts or images go through your mind?

You may think there are obvious answers to these questions. But if
you try this scenario on your friends and family, you'll probably get a
range of reactions. What each of us feels depends critically on why we
think the other person walked by us. This situation is ambiguous. It
can be interpreted in a variety of ways and thus can evoke a range of
emotional reactions.
Our emotional reactions depend on the story we tell ourselves, the

Why Unhappiness Won't Let Go

21

running commentary in the mind that interprets the data we receive
through our senses. If this scenario happens when we're in a good
mood, the running commentary in our mind is likely to tell us that the
person probably did not see us because he or she wasn't wearing glasses
or was preoccupied. We might feel little or no emotional reaction.
If we're feeling a bit down that day, our story, our self-talk, may tell
us that the person deliberately ignored us, that we've lost another
friend. Our mind may spin off, ruminating about what we did to upset
the person. Even if we had not been feeling very depressed at the start,
this sort of self-talk can make us feel worse. If the self-talk says we've
been ignored, we may feel angry. If it says we must have upset the per­
son in some way, we may feel guilty. If it says we've probably lost a
friend, we may feel lonely and sad.
Multiple different interpretations for the same set of facts are of­
ten possible. Our world is like a silent film on which we each write our
own commentary. And different interpretations of what has just hap­
pened can affect what happens next. With a benign interpretation, we
may quickly forget the incident. With a negative one, we may be
pitched into the kind of self-chiding that Alice did after her meeting
with her boss: What have I done? What's wrong with me? Why don't I have
more friends? Negative thoughts often come in disguise, masquerading
as questions that might have answers. Five or ten minutes later, the
questions may still be nagging us, with no answers making an appear­
ance.
Many situations are ambiguous, but the way we interpret them
makes a huge difference in how we react. This is the A-B-C model of
emotions. The A represents the facts of the situation-what a video
camera would see and record. The B is the interpretation we give to a
situation; this is the "running story" often j ust below the surface of
awareness. It is often taken as fact. The C is our reaction: our emo­
tions, body sensations, and behavior. Often we see the situation (A)
and the reaction ( C ) but are unaware of the interpretation (B). We
think the situation itself caused our emotional and physical reactions,
when in fact it was our interpretation of the situation.
"I knew my work wasn't good enough," said Alice after meeting

22

M I N D , B O D Y , A N D E M O T I ON

with her supervisor. Alice's supervisor had called the meeting because
he could see that Alice was exhausting herself and hoped to lighten
her load a little by getting her some help with proj ects. The supervisor
had not thought for a moment that Alice was failing.
"Wendy and the kids are sick to death of my feeling sorry for my­
self," reported J im. "They are not going to be able to put up with me
much longer." Actually, Jim's family was worried to death, and they
kept trying to come up with ways to cheer him up or j ust ignite a spark
of life in him again. J im was too ashamed of himself to take notice.
To complicate matters, our reactions then have an impact of their
own. When we feel low, we're likely to pick out and elaborate on the
most negative interpretation. Once we've seen someone pass us in the
street and our low mood has brought to mind the interpretation that
he or she "deliberately ignored me, " this only makes us feel even lower.
In tum, the increasingly deteriorating mood leads to questions about
why this person "snubbed me," which only marshals more evidence to
support our case of our own unlikability: This happened to me just last

week with so-and-so; I don't think anyone likes me ; I just can't make lasting
relationships ; What's wrong with me? The stream of thoughts begins to
settle on a theme of worthlessness, isolation, and inadequacy.
If you're familiar with this kind of thought stream, it may be help­
ful to know that you're not alone in this pattern of negative thinking.
In 1 980, Philip Kendall and Steven Hollon decided to make a list of
thoughts expressed by their depressed patients, shown in the box on
page 23. The themes of worthlessness and self-blame permeate the list.
If we're feeling okay at the moment, we might see quite clearly that
these thoughts are distortions. But when we're depressed, they can
seem like the absolute truth. It's as if depression is a war we wage
against ourselves, and we marshal every bit of negative propaganda we
can muster as ammunition. But who wins this war?
The fact that we often take these toxic and distorted thoughts
about ourselves as unassailable truth only cements the connection be­
tween sad feelings and self-critical thought streams. Knowing this is vi­
tally important to understanding why depression takes hold in some
people and not in others or on some occasions and not on others.

MIND, BODY , AND EMOTION

When such thoughts have affected us on one occasion, they remain
ready to be triggered on other occasions. And when they are triggered,
they drag our mood down even further, draining what little energy we
have at a time when we need all our resources to cope with what has
happened to us. Imagine what effect it would have on you if someone
stood behind you all day telling you how useless you were when you
were trying desperately to cope with a difficult experience. Now imag­
ine how much worse it would be if the criticism and harsh j udgment
came from inside your own mind. No wonder it seems so real-after
all, who knows us better than ourselves ? These thoughts can trap us,
turning a small sadness into a tangled web of brooding preoccupation.

Negative thoughts can trigger depression or feed it once a
low mood is upon us . We might sink into a glum mood by
thinking Nothing ever goes right for me. That mood may
then trigger self-criticism like Why am I such a loser? As we
try to unravel the cause of our unhappy state, our mood
plunges. As we investigate questions about our worthless­
ness, we form a whole scheme of other negative thoughts,
ready to be recruited at a moment's notice in the future .

Unhappiness itself is not the problem-it is an inherent and un­
avoidable part of being alive. Rather, it's the harshly negative views of
ourselves that can be switched on by unhappy moods that entangle us.
It is these views that transform passing sadness into persistent unhappi­
ness and depression. Once these harsh, negative views of ourselves are
activated, not only do they affect our mind, they also have profound ef­
fects on our body-and then the body in turn has profound effects on
the mind and emotions.

Depression and the Body
Depression affects the body, as demonstrated by the symptoms of maj or
depressive disorder presented earlier. It rapidly leads to dysregulation of

Why Unhappiness Won't Let Go

25

our eating habits, sleep, and energy levels. We might not feel like eat­
ing, which can eventually result in severe and unhealthy weight loss.
Or we might overeat, gaining inordinate amounts of weight. Our sleep
cycles can be disrupted in either direction too: either we feel low en­
ergy most of the time and sleep too much, or we find it difficult to get
enough sleep. We may find ourselves waking in the middle of the night
or early in the morning and being unable to get back to sleep. As in Al­
ice's case, we chum over and over the events of our lives and the inade­
quacy of our response to them.
The bodily changes we experience in depression can have pro­
found effects on how we feel and think about ourselves. If the changes
in the body wind up activating old themes of how inadequate and
worthless we are, then even minor and temporary changes in the body
can make our low mood deepen and persist.
Eighty percent of those who suffer from depression consult their
physician because of aches and pains in the body that they cannot ex­
plain. Much of this is linked to the tiredness and fatigue that come
with depression. In general, when we encounter something negative,
the body tends to tense up. Our evolutionary history has bequeathed us
a body that will prepare for action when it perceives a threat in the en­
vironment, such as a tiger, that we need to avoid or escape from. Our
heart rate speeds up, and blood is shifted away from the surface of the
skin and the digestive tract to the large muscles of the extremities,
which tense up in readiness to fight or flee or freeze. However, as we
will see in more detail in Chapters 2 and 6, the most ancient parts of
the brain make no distinction between the external threat of the tiger
and internal "threats" such as worries about the future or memories
from the past. When a negative thought or image arises in the mind,
there will be a sense of contraction, tightening, or bracing in the body
somewhere. It may be a frown, a stomach churning, a pallor in the
skin, or a tension in the lower back-all part of a preparation to freeze,
fight, or run.
Once the body reacts in this way to negative thoughts and images,
it feeds back to the mind the information that we are threatened or up­
set. Research has shown that the state of our bodies affects the state of

26

MIND, BODY, AND EMOTION

our minds without our having any awareness of it. I n one study, psy­
chologists asked people to watch cartoons and then rate how funny
they were. Some of the people had to do this while holding a pencil be­
tween their teeth, so that they inadvertently tightened up the muscles
used in smiling. Others had to hold a pencil between pursed lips, which
kept them from smiling. Those who watched using their smiling mus­
cles rated the cartoons as funnier. Another study asked people to watch
cartoons while using frowning muscles. The inadvertent frowners rated
cartoons as much less funny. In a third study, asking people to shake
their heads or nod while listening to information influenced their j udg­
ments about the information. In all of these cases, the people involved
were not aware of this physical influence.
What do these experiments tell us ? When we're unhappy, the ef­
fect of that mood on our body can bias the way we evaluate and inter­
pret things around us without our being even the slightest bit aware
that this is happening.
Sam was driving home after a tough day at work. Eager to put it
behind him, he looked forward to dinner and watching the basketball
game on TV afterward. He had no idea that he had a white-knuckle
grip on the steering wheel or that he had tensed his right arm muscles
all the way up to his shoulder. But when a car pulled abruptly in front
of him from a side street and forced him to put on his brakes, he leaned
on the horn and yelled, "Idiot ! Don't you have any respect for anyone
else out here ?" He was surprised to feel his face grow hot, and suddenly
he was grumbling mentally about the customer he'd had so much trou­
ble with and how that guy had no respect for anyone either and how no

one ever showed him any respect and he was fed up with messing up his
j ob and everything else. By the time he got home, he'd lost his appe­
tite, poured himself a stiff scotch, and refused to talk to his wife or kids
until the game was over.

I t's not just that patterns of negative thinking can affect
our moods and our bodies. Feedback loops in the other
direction, from the body to the mind, also play a critical

Why Unhappiness Won't Let Go

27

role in the persistent return and deepening of unhappiness
and dissatisfaction .

The close links between the body and emotion mean that our
bodies function as highly sensitive emotion detectors. They are giving
us moment-to-moment readouts of our emotional state. Of course most
of us aren't paying attention. We're too busy thinking. Many of us have
been brought up to ignore the body in the interest of achieving what­
ever goals we are striving to attain. As a rule, we have not been taught
to be attentive to our physical selves as a way of learning and growing,
to enhance our effectiveness in social interactions, and even for heal­
ing. In fact, if we struggle with depression, we may feel a strong aver­
sion to any signals that our body may be putting out. Those signals may
be of a constant state of tension, exhaustion, and chaos in the body.
We would prefer to have nothing to do with it in the hope that this in­
terior turbulence will subside on its own.
Naturally, not wanting to deal with the aches, pains, and frowns
means more avoidance and therefore more unconscious contraction in
the body and the mind. Gradually, we slow down and are less and less
able to function. Depression has started to affect the fourth aspect of
our lives: our behavior.

Depression and Behavior
As children or young adults, we may have been counseled by well­
meaning people to "soldier on" or "just get over it" when we were feel­
ing particularly downhearted or miserable. Perhaps, somewhere along
the way, we picked up the message that it was shameful or weak to
show our emotions. We naturally assumed that people would think the
worst of us if they knew we were depressed.
The thinking that accompanies depression, with its core themes of
inadequacy and unworthiness, is infinitely transportable to any situa­
tion. Without even knowing it, we can become stuck in believing with
great certainty that virtually any stress or difficulty we experience is

28

MIND, BODY, AND EMOTION

our fault and that it is our responsibility to sort it out for ourselves. And
when working harder doesn't solve anything, that's our fault too. The
result is terminal exhaustion.
Whenever Alice's mood began to sink, and she felt her energy was
j ust draining out of her, she consciously adopted a strategy of giving up
her "unimportant" and "nonessential" leisure activities, which actually
gave her pleasure, such as seeing friends or j ust going out for fun. As
she saw it, this strategy made sense because it meant that she could fo­
cus her dwindling energies (which she viewed as a strictly limited fixed
resource) on her more "important" and "essential" commitments and
responsibilities. This is understandable, except that her essential com­
mitments included being the perfect homemaker, mother, and em­
ployee, as well as, of course, meeting all the demands and expectations
of family, friends, colleagues, and bosses, whether or not these were rea­
sonable or realistic. In giving up the "nonessential and unimportant"
leisure activities that might have lifted her mood and extended rather
than depleted her reserves of energy, Alice deprived herself of one of
the simplest and most effective strategies for reversing a decline into
depression.
Professor Marie Asberg from the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm,
has described this "giving up" as drifting down a funnel of exhaustion
(see the figure ) . The funnel is created when the circles of our lives be­
come smaller and smaller. The narrower the funnel becomes, the more
likely a person is to experience burnout or exhaustion.
Jim also had noticed that he no longer looked forward to seeing
friends in the way that he normally did and that he wasn't getting the
same kick out of the things that he used to enjoy. Each time he consid­
ered going out, the thought arose, What's the point?-Nothing's going to

make any difference to the way I feel, so I ' ll save myself the effort, and stay
in and rest-that will make me feel better. Unfortunately, as J im was lying
on the couch resting, his mind simply drifted into well-worn self­
critical grooves. These, of course, all combined to create the perfect
setup for the persistence and deepening of his depression. J im's "rests"
ended up making him feel even worse.

The Exhaustion Funnel. The narrowing area of the circles illustrates the narrowing

of life as we give up the things in life that we enjoy but seem "optional. " The result is
that we stop doing activities that would nourish us, leaving only work or other stress­

ors that often deplete our resources. Professor Marie Asberg suggests that those of
us who continue downward are likely to be those who are the most conscientious

workers, those whose level of self-confidence is closely dependent on their perfor­

mance at work, that is, those who are often seen as the best workers, not the lazy
ones. The diagram also shows the sequence of accumulating "symptoms " experi­
enced by Jim as the funnel narrowed and he became more and more exhausted.

Depression makes us behave differently, and our behavior
can also feed depression. Depression certainly affects the
choices we make regarding what to do and not do, and
how to act. If we're convinced we're "no good" or
unworthy, how likely are we to pursue the things that we
value in life? And when we make choices informed by a
depressive state of mind, they're more than likely to keep
us stuck in our unhappiness.

If we have been depressed before, a low mood can become easier
and easier to trigger over time, because each time it returns, the
thoughts, feelings, body sensations, and behaviors that accompany it
form stronger and stronger connections to each other. Eventually, any
one element can trigger depression by itself. A fleeting thought of fail­
ure can trigger a huge sense of fatigue. A small comment by a family
member can trigger an avalanche of emotions such as guilt and regret,

30

feeding a sense of inadequacy. Because these downward spirals are so
easily triggered by small events or mood shifts, they feel as if they come
out of nowhere. And once depression takes hold, we can feel powerless
to prevent it from getting worse or to make it better. All our attempts
to control our thoughts or to snap out of our feelings are to no avail.
What can we do to prevent the normal and understandable emo­
tion of unhappiness from persisting or spiraling down into depression?
Our first challenge will be to understand why it is that we feel so pow­
erless to change how we are feeling and why, despite valiant efforts to
assert control, we are continually getting ourselves more and more
stuck. As we stated in the Introduction, we will discover that there are
very good reasons for this. It is not for want of trying or because there is
actually something wrong with us. Rather, it is because our efforts have
taken us in the wrong direction!
Freedom from depression is possible, but that freedom comes from
an entirely different perspective and understanding of what the prob­
lem actually is-that perspective will serve as a map to guide us into a
new territory within our own being and experience, where we can tap
into and harness deep interior resources of the mind that most of us
never suspected we had.

depressed. We start to feel bad, and before we know it we've been
pulled down into the spiral, and no amount of struggle will get us out.
In fact, the more we struggle, the deeper we end up mired. We may
blame ourselves for feeling bad in the first place-and especially for
feeling worse the more we think about it. But what is really at work is a
certain mental pattern, or mode of mind, that is triggered so automati­
cally by unpleasant emotion that we hardly notice or know what is ac­
tually happening.
To see these mental mechanisms for what they are, we have to ex­
plore emotion and how we react to it. This exploration will reveal ex­
actly how the struggle itself pulls us down-and how unj ust it is to
blame ourselves. Even more important, understanding that it is a cer­
tain mode of mind that gets us stuck opens the door to an alternative
way of dealing with emotion: making a radical shift to a different mode
of mind. Within that very shift, practiced over and over again in key
moments, lies the possibility of transforming our relationship with de­
pression and freeing ourselves from its grip.

MIND, BODY, AND EMOTION

THE RO LE OF EMO TIO N

On one important level, our emotions are vital messengers. They
evolved as signals to help us meet our basic needs for self-preservation
and safety and to survive individually and as a species. The human
emotional repertoire is remarkably sophisticated, its inner and outer
expressions and messages often eloquent and complex. Even so, there
are really only a few basic families of emotions. The most prominent
are happiness, sadness, fear, disgust, and anger. Each emotion is a full­
body reaction to a characteristic situation: fear is triggered when dan­
ger threatens; sadness and grief when something precious is lost; disgust
when something highly unpleasant is confronted; anger when an im­
portant goal is blocked; happiness when our needs are met. Naturally,
we pay attention to these signals. They tell us what to do to survive
and even thrive.
For the most part, our emotional reactions evolved to be tempo­
rary. They have to be. The messenger needs to be alert to the need to
signal the next alarm. Our initial emotional reaction lasts only as long
as the subj ect of the alarm continues-often a few seconds rather than
a few minutes. For it to last longer would make us insensitive to further
changes in the environment. We can see this clearly in the behavior of
gazelle on the African savannah. Fear drives them to run desperately to
avoid the predator that is chasing the herd. But once a gazelle has been
captured, the rest of the herd rapidly resumes grazing, as if nothing had
happened. The situation has changed; the danger is past; the herd also
needs to eat to survive.
Of course, some situations endure, and so may our emotional reac­
tion to them. Sadness as a response to the loss of someone dear to us
may continue for a long time. Grief can continue to come in unex­
pected waves that may well up and overwhelm us for many weeks and
months after the loss. Even here, however, the mind has ways of heal­
ing itself. Even with grief, most people find that, little by little, life
eventually returns to some sense of normalcy and they begin to dis­
cover the possibility of smiling and laughing once again.
Why, then, do depression and unhappiness outlast the situations

The Healing Power of Awareness

33

that trigger them ? Or why, sometimes, does a sense of malaise and dis­
satisfaction go on and on? The short answer is that these emotions per­
sist because we have emotional reactions to our own emotions that ac­
tually keep them going.

The Problem with Our Own Emotional Reactions
to Our Emotions
Carole often finds herself feeling "a little miserable" right before she
goes to bed. Naturally this bothers her, especially because she can't al­
ways connect the feeling to any event that directly precedes the mood.
"Last Friday, for example," she explained, "Angie came over and we
spent the evening watching TV. Everything was fine. Then after she
left, I went around the apartment clearing up, and I realized that a feel­
ing of sadness had crept up on me. I started to think of times in the past
when friends had let me down. When this happens, my mind always
goes along the same lines: Why am I feeling miserable again and dragging

all this uP? Was I miserable all evening but j ust distracting myself be­
cause Angie was here, or is it the silence at bedtime that gets to me ?
Carole often tries to distract herself from her mood by reading or
watching TV in bed . . . but she finds that it mostly doesn't help. She is
soon distracted by her own thoughts.
"I try to find a reason why I'm feeling the way I am: What hap­

pened today that made me feel like this? I can usually think of
something that went wrong, like when Jean went out for
lunch without telling me she was going, and I wondered
whether we are still friends. But it often doesn't really feel
like it explains how I am feeling right now. So I start wonder­
ing what is wrong with me that I feel this way when other
people seem quite happy. Soon I 've dragged up lots of nega­
tive stuff, and I start to think, Perhaps I'm always going to feel

this way . How will my life be if these feelings last? How will I get
on with people or do my job then? Will I ever feel really happy ?
And, of course, that j ust drags me down further. I end up

34

M I N D , B O D Y , A N D E M O T I ON

feeling really bad about myself: everything seems so much
effort-making friends, doing my j ob, everything.
"Sometimes I can see exactly what I'm doing: I'm mak­
ing myself more miserable. Maybe I 'll get distracted by a noise
outside my window, and somehow that gives me j ust enough
of a gap to see how bad I'm suddenly feeling. I'm really
shocked at how bad I can get. Once this week I was lying in
bed feeling bad when I shifted position, and something about
moving reminded me of the feeling I'd had when I got under
the covers j ust a few minutes earlier-that deep, luxurious
feeling of comfort and warmth, of having cool sheets and a
soft pillow to help me rest. Everything had seemed right with
the world at that instant, I realized, so how had that feeling
escaped me ? I said to myself then, as I have other times: All

this thinking is doing me no good at all. But then I said to myself,
So why do I do this to myself all the time? Then I set off on an­
other round of thinking about what's wrong with me."
Carole could see that her reactions to her sadness were actually
making her more miserable. Her attempts to feel better-by trying des­
perately to understand what was going on in her mind-actually made
her feel worse.

Our reactions to unhappiness can transform what might
otherwise be a brief, passing sadness into persistent
dissatisfaction and unhappiness.

The problem with persistent and recurrent depression is not "get­
ting sad" in the first place. Sadness is a natural mind-state, an inherent
part of being human. It is neither realistic nor desirable to imagine that
we can or should get rid of it. The problem is what happens next, im­
mediately after the sadness comes. The problem is not the sadness itself,

but how our minds react to the sadness .

"Get Me Out of Here! "
The fact is that when emotions are telling us that something is not as it
should be, the feeling is distinctly uncomfortable. It's meant to be. The
signals are exquisitely designed to push us to act, to do something to
rectify the situation. If the signal didn't feel uncomfortable, didn't cre­
ate an urge to act, would we leap out of the path of a speeding truck,
step in when we saw a child being bullied, tum away from something
that we found repugnant? It's only when the mind registers that the sit­
uation is resolved that the signal shuts itself off.
When the problem that our emotions signal needs to be solved is
"out there"-a charging bull or a roaring funnel cloud-reacting in a
way that will allow us to avoid it or escape from it makes sense. The
brain mobilizes a whole pattern of mostly automatic reactions that help
us deal with whatever is threatening our survival, helping us get rid of
or avoid the threat. We call this initial pattern of reactions-in which
we feel negatively toward and want to avoid or eliminate something­

aversion . Aversion forces us to act in some appropriate way to the situa­
tion and thereby tum off the warning signal. In this regard, it can serve
us well, can even save our lives. Sometimes.
But it's not hard to see that the same reactions are going to be
counterproductive and even dangerous to our well-being when di­
rected at what's going on "in here"-toward our own thoughts, feelings,
and sense of self. None of us can run fast enough to escape our own in­
ner experience. Nor can we eliminate unpleasant, oppressive, and
threatening thoughts and feelings by fighting with them and trying to
annihilate them.
When we react to our own negative thoughts and feelings with
aversion, the brain circuitry involved in physical avoidance, submis­
sion, or defensive attack ( the "avoidance system" of the brain) is acti­
vated. Once this mechanism is switched on, the body tenses as if it
were either getting ready to run or bracing itself for an assault. We can
also sense the effects of aversion in our minds. When we are preoccu­
pied, dwelling on how to get rid of our feelings of sadness or disconnec-

36

MIND, BODY, AND EMOTION

tion, our whole experience is one of contraction. The mind, driven to
focus on the compelling yet futile task of getting rid of these feelings,
closes in on itself. And with it, our experience of life itself narrows.
Somehow we feel cramped, boxed in. The choices available to us seem
to dwindle. We come to feel increasingly cut off from the wider space
of possibilities that we long to connect with.
Over our lifetime, we may have come to dislike or even hate emo­
tions such as fear, sadness, or anger, in ourselves and in others. If we
have, for example, been taught not to "be so emotional," we will have
picked up the message that expression of emotion is somewhat un­
seemly and may have assumed it wasn't okay to feel emotion either. Or
maybe we remember clearly the drawn-out feeling of an emotional ex­
perience like grief and now react with dread when a hint of similar
feelings arises.
When we react negatively-with aversion-to our own negative
emotions, treating them as enemies to be overcome, eradicated, and
defeated, we get into trouble. So understanding aversion becomes fun­
damental to understanding what gets us stuck in persistent unhappi­
ness. We run into problems because the unhappiness we are feeling
now

triggers old, extraordinarily unhelpful patterns of thinking from

the past.

MOO D AND M EMO RY

Have you ever visited a place that you haven't been to for many years,
perhaps since childhood ? Before the visit, memory of things that hap­
pened at that time of your life may be quite sketchy. But once you get
there, walking down the streets, taking in the smells and the sounds
may bring it all back-not j ust memories, but feelings: of excitement,
of sorrow, of first love. Returning to the place-the old context-does
something that our best efforts to remember could not do nearly as
well.
Context has incredibly powerful effects on memory. Memory re­
searchers Duncan Godden and Alan Baddeley found that if deep-sea

The Healing Power of Awareness

37

divers tried to commit something to memory while on the beach, they
tended to forget it when under water and were able to recall it fully
only when they were back on dry land. It worked the other way around
too. If they learned a list of words under water, their memory of that list
when on dry land was not so good, but came back when they returned
to the water. The sea and the beach acted as powerful contexts for the
memory, j ust like a visit to a childhood town or an old campus haunt.

Memories Triggered by Mood
Over the last few years, psychologists have discovered something really
important about how our emotional states can have such pervasive ef­
fects on our minds. A mood can function as an internal context; it can
act in the same way that the sea did for the divers, bringing back mem­
ories and patterns of thinking that are associated with times when we
were in that mood, j ust as if we had dived again into that particular
stretch of water. When we return to that mood , thoughts and memories re­

lated to whatever was going on in our mind or world to make us unhappy will
come back quite automatically , whether we want it to happen or not . When
the mood comes up again, so do the thoughts and memories connected
with it, including the thinking patterns that created that mood.
Because we live different lives, the experiences that provoked un­
happiness in the past will differ from one person to another. For that
reason, we differ, one from another, in the kinds of memories and thinking

patterns that get reactivated by the moods we are experiencing in this mo­
ment. If the main things that made us sad in the past were losses, such
as the sad but expected death of a beloved grandparent, when we feel
passing sadness now, these will be the memories that come to mind.
We may feel sad again, but we may have no trouble acknowledging our
loss and then shifting the focus of the mind to other things while the
echo of the grief fades in its own good time.
But what if our previous moods of unhappiness or depression were
evoked by situations that somehow led to our thinking and feeling that
we were not good enough, that we were worthless, or frauds ? What if in
childhood or adolescence, at a time when we did not have the life

38

M I N D , BODY, AN D EMOTION

skills we now have, we experienced overwhelming feelings of being
abandoned, abused, lonely, or j ust plain no good ? Sadly, we now know
that many people who become depressed as adults have had such expe­
riences. If for us they were a significant part of childhood, the thinking
patterns that made us depressed then, the sense that we are not good
enough in some way, are highly likely to be reactivated in the present
by even a passing feeling of depression.

This is why we can react so negatively to unhappiness : our
experience is not one simply of sadness, but is colored
powerfully by reawakened feelings of deficiency or
inadequacy. What may make these reactivated thinking
patterns most damaging is that we often don't realize they
are memories at all . We feel not good enough now without
being aware that it is a thinking pattern from the past that
is evoking the feeling.

When Carole was fourteen, she changed schools when her parents
moved across the state. She missed her old friends, and although they
had promised to stay in touch, it didn't happen. She found it really
hard to make friends at her new school, and she deliberately kept to
herself, not j oining in activities with others, and soon they ignored her
completely. She felt lonely, cut off, and unwanted.
Carole couldn't wait to get out of high school. She came back into
her own in college. But she was always prey to unpredictable mood
shifts that would drain her of energy and send her shuffling back into
an isolated corner somewhere, sometimes for a few weeks at a time.
Her mood could begin to slide at any time. Recently any slight sadness
could retrigger the whole constellation of feelings of inadequacy from
the past, leaving her feeling lonely and friendless. When this hap­
pened, she found herself unable to switch her attention back to what
she was doing-her mind seemed completely taken over by her feel­
ings.

The Healing Power of Awareness

39

Carole's experience shows clearly the cycle that afflicts so many
people. Once negative memories, thoughts, and feelings, reactivated by
unhappy moods, have forced their way into our consciousness, they
produce two major effects. First, naturally enough, they increase our
unhappiness, as Carole found, depressing mood even further. Second,
they will bring with them a set of seemingly urgent priorities for what
the mind has absolutely got to focus on--our deficiencies and what we
can do about them. It is these priorities that dominate the mind and
make it so difficult to switch attention to anything else. Thus we find
ourselves compulsively trying over and over to get to the bottom of
what is wrong with us as people, or with the way we live our lives, and
fix it.
Caught up in this way, how on earth could we possibly contem­
plate switching our attention away from these pressing and under­
standable concerns to focus on other topics or approaches, even if do­
ing so might contribute to a lightening of our mood ? Sorting things out
and forcing a solution will always seem like the most compelling thing
to do--figuring out what it is that is not good enough about us, sorting
out what we need to do to minimize the havoc that our unhappiness
will wreak in our lives if it persists. But in fact focusing on these issues
in this way is using exactly the wrong tools for the j ob. It simply fuels
further unhappiness and keeps us fixated on the very thoughts and
memories that are making us unhappy. It is as if a horror story were be­
ing enacted in front of us: we hate looking, but, at the same time, we
can't tum away.

The Critical Moment
We can't change the fact that past memories and self-critical and j udg­
mental ways of thinking are triggered when we feel unhappy. It all hap­
pens quite automatically. But we may be able to change what happens
next.
If Carole had seen how a slight shift in her mood was reactivating

old patterns of mind that were around at a time in her life when she felt

40

M I N D , B ODY , A N D E M O T I O N

alone, misunderstood, and devalued, she might have been able to let it
float by and gone on with her day. She might even have been able to
treat herself with a little kindness.
We can learn to relate differently to our unhappiness in j ust those
ways. The first step is to see even more clearly the ways in which we
entangle ourselves. In particular, we need to become more aware of the
pattern, or mode, of mind that gets switched on and can cause so much
suffering.

DO ING MO DE : WHEN CRITICAL THINKING
VO LUNTEERS FO R A JO B IT CAN ' T DO

When the thinking reawakened by depressed mood tells us that we are
the problem, we want to get rid of these feelings right now. But larger is­
sues have been triggered and dredged up: it is not j ust that today is not
going well, our whole life feels as if it is not going well. We feel caught
in a prison, and we have to find a way to escape.
The problem is that we try to think our way out of our moods
by working out what's gone wrong. What's wrong with me? Why do I al­

ways feel overwhelmed? Before we have any idea what hit us, we're com­
pulsively trying over and over to get to the bottom of what is wrong
with us as people or with the way we live our lives, and fix it. We put all
of our mental powers to work on the problem, and the power we rely
on is that of our critical thinking skills.
Unfortunately, those critical thinking skills might be exactly the

wrong tools for the job .
We're rightly proud of what we can do through critical analytical
thinking. It's one of the highest achievements of our evolutionary his­
tory as human beings and does get us out of a whole slew of fixes in life.
So when we see things are not going well in our internal, emotional life,
it's hardly surprising that the mind often quickly reacts by recruiting
the mode of mind that functions so effectively in solving problems in
our external world. This mode of careful analysis, problem solving, j udg­
ment, and comparison is aimed at closing the gap between the way

The Healing Power of Awareness

41

things are and the way w e think they should be-at solving perceived
problems. Therefore we call it the doing mode of mind . It's the mode by
which we respond to what we hear as a call to action.

Doing mode is mobilized because it usually works very well in help­
ing us to achieve our goals in everyday situations and in solving work­
related technical problems. Consider the simple everyday action of
driving across town. For making a j ourney, the doing mode of mind en­
ables us to reach the goal by creating an idea of where we are now ( at
home ) and an idea of where we want to be ( at the stadium) . It then au­
tomatically focuses on the mismatch between these two ideas, generat­
ing actions aimed at narrowing the gap (get in the car and drive ) . It
continuously monitors whether the gap is getting bigger or smaller to
check whether these actions are having the desired effect of reducing
the "distance left to travel" between the two ideas. If need be, it adj usts
the actions to make sure the gap is decreasing rather than increasing. It
then repeats the process over and over again. Finally, the gap is closed,
we've reached our destination, the goal has been achieved, and the do­
ing mode is ready to take on the next task.
This strategy offers us a very general approach for attaining our
goals and solving our problems: if there is something we want to hap­
pen, we focus on narrowing the gap between our idea of where we are
and our idea of where we want to be. If there is something we don't
want to happen, we focus on increasing the gap between our idea of
where we are and our idea of what we want to avoid. This doing mode
of mind not only enables us to manage the routine details of our daily
lives but also underlies some of the most awe- inspiring accomplish­
ments of the human species in transforming the external world, from
the construction of the pyramids, to the engineering feat of modern
skyscrapers, to putting a man on the Moon. All these achievements re­
quired exquisite and elegant problem solving of a certain kind. It is
quite natural, then, that the same mental strategies should get re­
cruited when we want to transform our interior world-to change our­
selves so that we can attain happiness, for example, or get rid of unhap­
piness. Unfortunately, this is where things can start to go horribly
wrong.

42

M I N D , BODY, AN D EMOTION

Why We Can 't Problem-Solve Our Emotions
Imagine yourself walking along a path by a river on a sunny day. You're
feeling a little down, a little out of sorts. At first you're not really aware
of your mood, but then you realize you don't feel very happy. You're
also aware that the sun is shining. You think, It's a lovely day ; I should be

feeling happy .
Let that thought sink in: I should be feeling happy .
How do you feel now ? If you feel worse, you're not alone. Virtually
everyone reports the same response. Why ? Because, in the case of our
moods, the very act of focusing on the gap, comparing how we are feel­
ing with how we want to feel ( or how we think we should feel) makes us
feel unhappy, taking us even further away from how we want to be. Fo­
cusing on the gap in this way is actually a reflection of the mind's ha­
bitual strategy for trying to sort out situations in which things aren't as
we want them to be.
Normally, if our mood is not too intense, we may hardly notice the
slight downturn in our feelings when we make a comparison between
how we feel and how we'd like to feel. However, if the mind is in doing
mode-trying to solve "problems" like "What's wrong with me ?" and
"Why am I so weak ?"-we can get trapped in the very thinking that was re­

cruited to rescue us . The mind will naturally bring up ( and then hold in
consciousness ) the relevant ideas it is working on-for instance, an
idea of the kind of person I am right now ( sad and lonely ) , an idea of
the kind of person I want to be ( peaceful and happy) , and an idea of
the kind of person I fear I might become if the sadness persists and I
sink into depression (pathetic and weak ) . The doing mode then fo­
cuses on the mismatch between these ideas, the ways in which we are
not the people we want to be.

Focusing on the mismatch between our idea of the people we want to be
and our idea of the people we see ourselves as makes us feel worse than we
did in the first place, when the doing mode started its attempts to help. It
uses mental time travel to "help," calling up past times when we may
have felt like this in an effort to understand what went wrong, and
imagining a future, blighted by unhappiness, to remind us that this is

The Healing Power of Awareness

43

what we desperately need to avoid. The memories of previous failures
and the images of feared future scenarios that we bring to mind in the
process add their own twist to the spiral of worsening mood. The more
we have suffered low mood in the past, the more negative will be the
images and self-talk unlocked by our present mood, and the more our
mind will be dominated by these old patterns. But they seem real to us

now. These patterns of feeling worthless or lonely feel familiar, but in­
stead of seeing the feeling of familiarity as a sign that the mind is going
down an old mental groove, we take the feeling of familiarity to mean that
it must all be true. That's why we can't snap out of it, as our family and
friends may have been urging. We cannot let go, because the doing
mode of mind insists that our highest priority is to sort ourselves out by
identifying and solving this "problem." So we hammer ourselves with
more questions: "Why do I always react this way ?," "Why can't I han­
dle things better ?," "Why do I have problems other people don't
have ?," "What am I doing to deserve this ?"
You may think of this self-focused, self-critical frame of mind as

brooding. Psychologists also call it rumination. When we ruminate, we
become fruitlessly preoccupied with the fact that we are unhappy and
with the causes, meanings, and consequences of our unhappiness. Re­
search has repeatedly shown that if we have tended to react to our sad
or depressed moods in these ways in the past, then we are likely to find
the same strategy volunteering to "help" again and again when our
mood starts to slide. And it will have the same effect: we'll get stuck in
the very mood from which we are trying to escape. As a consequence,
we are at even higher risk of experiencing repeated bouts of unhappi­
ness.
Why, then, do we ruminate ? Why, like Carole, do we continue to
dwell on thoughts about our unhappiness when it j ust seems to make
things worse ? When researchers ask people who ruminate a lot why
they do it, a simple answer emerges: They do it because they believe it
will help them overcome their unhappiness and depression. They be­
lieve that not doing it will make their condition worse and worse.
We ruminate when we feel low because we believe that it will re­
veal a way to solve our problems. But research shows that rumination

44

MIND, BODY, AND EMOTION

does exactly the opposite: our ability to solve problems actually deterio­

rates markedly during rumination. All the evidence seems to point to
the stark truth that rumination is part of the problem, not part of the solu­
tion .
Imagine a car trip during which, every time we check to see how
close we are to our destination, we find that the car has instantly
moved farther away from it. This is tantamount to what happens in the
interior world of emotions and feeling states when we call in the doing
mode of mind. That's why we often find ourselves saying things like "I
don't know why I feel so depressed; I've got nothing to be depressed
about," and then discovering that we feel even more unhappy. We've
checked our destination of feeling happy and found ourselves farther
away from it. We can't seem to stop reminding ourselves how bad we
feel.

Spilt Milk
It was the 1 940s, and the Second World War was still raging in Europe.
An old dairy farmer in England was talking to a new farmhand who
had recently come to help with the cows as part of his rehabilitation af­
ter being wounded on the front lines. The farmhand had been learning
how to call the cattle back to the bam, lead them into their stalls, give
them their food, clean them, milk them, then take the pails full of milk
to the cooler and then to the chums. The farmhand was upset because
he had spilt some of the milk from the chum and had tried hosing it
down with water. As the farmer came around the comer, there was the
inexperienced farmhand, gazing in despair at the huge white puddle he
had created. "Ah," said the farmer, "I see your problem. Once the water
has mixed with the milk, it all looks the same. If you've spilt a pint, it'll
look like a gallon. And if you've spilt a gallon, it looks like . . . well, a
bit like that lake you're standing in. The trick is j ust to deal with the
milk you've spilt. Let it run off, sweep up what's left into the drain; and
when it's pretty clear, then you can hose it down."
The milk the farmhand had originally spilt was now mixed with
the water he'd been trying to clear it up with, and it all looked the same.

The Healing Power of Awareness

45

And so it is with our moods. Our best attempts to clear them up can
make them worse, but we don't realize this is what is happening: it all looks
the same and so simply intensifies our desperate attempts to fix things.
Nobody waves a flag at us and says, "Wait j ust a minute; that extra mis­
ery you j ust felt was not part of the mood you were feeling when you
started." There is nothing "out there" to remind us that, even with the
very best of intentions, we are actually making matters considerably
worse for ourselves.
Ironically, as all this is happening, the mood that triggered the
whole process in the first place may well have moved on. But we don't
notice that it has faded of its own accord. We're too busy trying to get
rid of it and creating more misery in our attempts.

Rumination invariably backfires. It merely compounds our
misery. I t's a heroic attempt to solve a problem that it is
just not capable of solving. Another mode of mind
altogether is required when it comes to dealing with
unhappiness.

The Alternative to Rumination
If Carole had been able to relate differently to the feelings that came
over her as she was clearing up her apartment, she might not have
gotten lost in the vortex of thinking, thinking, and more thinking.
She might have realized that the initial feeling was a passing sadness
that often arose when an evening with a friend came to an end. Sad­
ness can arise when friends leave. No further "causes" needed to be
unearthed. But we don't like to feel sad because it can quickly turn
into a sense that we are somehow flawed or incomplete; so we call in
the intellect to focus on the mismatch between what "is" and what
"should be." Because we can't accept the discomfort of the message,
we try to shoot the messenger and end up shooting ourselves in the
foot.
There is an alternative strategy for handling the negative moods,

memories, and thinking patterns in the present moment,

as

they arise .

Evolution has bequeathed us an alternative to critical thinking, and we
humans have only j ust begun to realize its power to transform us. It is
called awareness .

MINDFULNESS : THE S EEDS OF AWARENESS

In a sense we've been familiar with this alternative capacity of ours all
along. It's j ust that the doing mode of mind has eclipsed it. This capac­
ity does not work by critical thinking but through awareness itself. We
call it the being mode of mind.
We don't only think about things. We also experience them di­
rectly through our senses. We are capable of directly sensing and re­
sponding to things like tulips, cars, and a cold wind. And we can be
aware of ourselves experiencing. We have intuitions about things and
feelings. We know things not only with the head, but also with the
heart and with the senses. Furthermore, we can be aware of ourselves
thinking; thinking is not all there is to conscious experience. The being
mode is an entirely different way of knowing from the thinking of doing
mode. Not better, j ust different. But it gives us a whole other way of liv­
ing our lives and of relating to our emotions, our stress, our thoughts,
and our bodies. And it is a capacity that we all already have. It's j ust
been a bit neglected and underdeveloped.

Being mode is the antidote to the problems that the doing mode of mind
creates .
By cultivating the awareness of being mode we can:
•

Get out of our heads and learn to experience the world directly,

experientially, without the relentless commentary of our thoughts. We
might just open ourselves up to the limitless possibilities for happiness that life
has to offer us .
•

See our thoughts as mental events that come and go in the

mind like clouds across the sky instead of taking them literally. The idea

that we're no good , unlovable , and ineffectual can finally be seen

as

just

The Healing Power of Awareness

47

that--an idea--and not necessarily as the truth , which just might make it
easier to disregard.
• Start living right here, in each present moment. When we stop
dwelling on the past or worrying about the future , we 're open to rich sources
of information we 've been missing out on-information that can keep us out
of the downward spiral and poised for a richer life .
• Disengage the autopilot in our heads. Being more aware of
ourselves-through the senses , the emotions , and the mind---can help us aim
our actions where we really want them to go and make us effective problem
solvers .
•

Sidestep the cascade of mental events that draws us down into

depression. When awareness is cultivated, we may be able to recognize at

an early stage the times we are most likely to slide into depression and re­
spond to our moods in ways that keep us from being pulled down further.
•

Stop trying to force life to be a certain way because we're un­

comfortable right now. We' ll be able to see that wanting things to be differ­

ent from how they are right now is where rumination begins .
The rest of this book describes in detail how you can cultivate the
type of awareness we're talking about. The core skill is mindfulness. It
can profoundly change your life.

What Is Mindfulness?
Mindfulness is the awareness that emerges through paying attention on pur­
pose , in the present moment, and non-judgmentally to things as they are .
Pay attention to what ? you might ask. To anything, but especially to
those aspects of life that we most take for granted or ignore. For in­
stance, we might start paying attention to the basic components of ex­
perience, like how we feel, what is on our minds, and how we perceive
or know anything at all. Mindfulness means paying attention to things
as they actually are in any given moment, however they are, rather
than as we want them to be . Why does paying attention in this way
help ? Because it is the exact antithesis to the type of ruminative think­
ing that makes low moods persist and return.

48

MIND, BODY, AND EMOTION

First, mindfulness is intentional. When we are cultivating mindful­
ness, we can be more aware of present reality and the choices available
to us. We can act with awareness. By contrast, rumination is often an
automatic reaction to whatever triggers us. It is tantamount to un­
awareness, being lost in thought.
Second, mindfulness is experiential , and it focuses directly on present­
moment experience. By contrast, when we ruminate, our minds are pre­
occupied with thoughts and abstractions that are far away from direct
sensory experience. Rumination propels our thoughts into the past or
into an imagined future.
Third, mindfulness is non-judgmental. Its virtue is that it allows us
to see things as they actually are in the present moment and to allow
them to be as they already are. By contrast, j udging and evaluating are
integral to rumination and the entire doing mode. Judgments of any
sort {good or bad, right or wrong} imply that we or the things around
us have to measure up in some way to an internal or external standard.
The habit of j udging ourselves severely disguises itself as an attempt to
help us to live better lives and to be better people, but in actuality the
habit of j udging winds up functioning as an irrational tyrant that can
never be satisfied.
By cultivating mindfulness, Carole might become aware of the in­
tricate interconnections between external events, her feelings, her
thoughts, and her behaviors, noticing more and more how one can
trigger the other and the entire spiral of depression. She might no lon­
ger repeatedly feel quite so stuck in a seemingly never-ending depres­
sion because she now has new and wiser ways to relate to her experi­
ence in the present moment. She might even find a way to be kind to
herself in those times that she is feeling most vulnerable, and this in
tum might increase her enthusiasm for taking up new interests and
making new friends.
As explained in the rest of this book, practicing mindfulness is
more than j ust noticing things around us that we hadn't noticed be­
fore. It is learning to become aware of the particular mode of mind that
gets us stuck when misapplied to ourselves and our emotional life. The
following chapters describe practical skills for disengaging from that

mode when i t i s not serving u s and shifting t o a n alternative mode of
mind that will not get us stuck. With an increasing ability to sustain
mindfulness, we can explore what happens when our emotions are al­
lowed to come and go in awareness with a non-j udgmental attitude
and self-compassion.
As you'll see in the next chapter, the practice of mindfulness
teaches us to shift into being mode so that we can be more at peace
with our emotions. Our emotions are not the enemy, after all, but mes­
sages that reconnect us in the most basic and intimate of ways with the
adventure and experience of being alive.

Cultivating Mindfulnes s
A First Taste

A W E L L -K N O W N T RAV E L W R IT E R WAS I N V IT E D TO

dine at the home of a well-to-do Japanese family. His host had invited
a number of guests, letting it be known that he had something of great
importance to share. Part of the meal would consist of blowfish, con­
sidered a superb delicacy in Japan, in part because these fish are fatally
poisonous unless the poison has been removed by a highly skilled chef.
To be served such a fish was a great honor.
As guest of honor, the writer received the fish with great anticipa­
tion and savored every mouthful. The taste was, indeed, like nothing
he had ever eaten. What, asked his host, did he think of the experi­
ence ? The guest was ecstatic about the exquisite flavor of the fish he
had sampled. He did not have to exaggerate, for it was indeed sublime,
among the best food he had ever tasted. Only then did his host reveal
that the fish he had eaten was a common variety. Another guest, with­
out realizing it, had eaten the blowfish. The "important thing" the
writer learned was not how good a rare and expensive delicacy tasted
but how amazing ordinary food could be if he paid close attention to
each mouthful.

BEING AWARE

As he ate the ordinary fish, the writer had an extraordinary experience.
The experience was brought about by a shift in the way the writer was
53

54

M O M EN T BY M O M E N T

paying attention and the resulting quality of his awareness. His host
had artfully arranged a situation that would ensure this shift. The fun­
damental lesson of this book is that we can learn how to bring that
same quality of attention to any experience and as a result transform
the nature of our experience. This type of awareness, known as mindful­

ness, is much more than paying attention more thoroughly. It is paying
attention differently--changing how we pay attention .
If asked, most of us would say we already pay attention-we have
to, j ust to get everything done we need to do. Or, if we have been
chronically unhappy, we may also feel that we are already far too
aware-at least of the pain we feel when we are feeling down. But the
kind of attention most of us customarily pay, particularly when de­
pressed, is attention via tunnel vision. Our attention tends to be aimed
at a problem to be solved, as discussed in Chapter 2. Everything that
the mind tells us is irrelevant to the problem at hand tends to drop out
of our field of vision. Through mindfulness we can experience a mo­
ment of life for all that it is, instead of letting our thoughts drag us
somewhere we weren't going in the first place. Mindfulness can free us
from the trap of rumination and endless "doing" that only imprisons us
in further unhappiness and depression.
As we said toward the end of the preceding chapter, mindfulness is
the awareness that arises from paying attention on purpose , in the present
moment, non-judgmentally , to things as they are. It's a way of shifting from
doing to being so that we take in all the information that an experience
offers us before we act. Being mindful means that we suspend j udgment
for a time, set aside our immediate goals for the future, and take in the
present moment as it is rather than as we would like it to be. It means
we approach situations with openness, even if we notice that they
bring up feelings such as fear. Being mindful means intentionally turn­
ing off the autopilot mode in which we operate so much of the time­
brooding about the past, for instance, or worrying about the future­
and instead tuning in to things as they are in the present with full
awareness. It means knowing that our thoughts are passing mental
events, not reality itself, and that we are more in touch with life as it is
when we allow ourselves to experience things through the body and

way of paying attention is.
To demonstrate it to yourself, you might like to try this simple exercise
right now to get a feel for the vividness of an experience when the
mind is intentionally and non-j udgmentally present for its unfolding. If
you can, give yourself permission to spend several minutes on this. If
you feel you can't do that right now, you might try it a little later, when
you do have the time.

If you have time, you might want to do the exercise with another
raisin, perhaps even more slowly, staying aware of any tendency to
compare the second raisin to the first one rather than experiencing it
on its own terms.
What happens when we engage in this simple exercise whole­
heartedly ? Just as with the blowfish story, it can give rise to a number of
important insights. Tom, a participant in a mindfulness class, was
struck by the contrast between this

exercise and his usual way of eating:
"I knew I was eating the raisin," he
said. "It was so much more vivid than
when I normally shovel them into my
mouth."

Gabriela made a similar comment: " I was very aware of what we
were doing. I've never tasted a raisin like that before. Actually, I've
never noticed what a raisin looked like. At first it looked dead and
crinkly, but then I noticed how the light struck it in different ways, like
a j ewel. When I first put it in my mouth, it was hard at first to stop my­
self from instantly chewing it. Then, when I was exploring it with my
tongue, I was able to tell which side was which-but there was no
taste. Then when eventually I bit down on it-wow, it was absolutely
amazing. I'd never tasted anything like it."
So how did this difference arise for Gabriela ? "It's not what I nor­
mally do," she said. "It's not how I normally eat raisins. I don't put a lot
of thought into what I do. I do it automatically. This time I was really
focused on what we were doing rather than thinking of other things."
In this simple mindfulness exercise, Tom and Gabriela had a direct
sampling of a new way of relating to experience. They had experienced
first hand the contrast between habitual doing mind, on the one hand,
and, on the other, remaining fully in touch with each moment, in be­
ing mode. They were eating and knowing that they were eating. They
were eating mindfully.
Slowing things down and deliberately paying attention to each as­
pect of our sensory experience can reveal things that we may have
never noticed before. The smell of the raisin may be different from
what we had imagined. The texture of the raisin on the tongue may be
a novel experience. The taste itself is something we may simply have
not experienced before in this way, often richer than the taste of
twenty raisins shoved mindlessly into the mouth. Being mindful in this
way can radically transform the nature of our experience of eating.
If being mindful can so transform our experience of eating, what
could it do for the experience of a sad mood ? If we can be present for it,
with it, and during it, we could bring to that mood a mind that is ready
to experience j ust that moment, with no presuppositions or assumptions
about it whatsoever. Eventually we may reach the point where every
moment of sadness is no longer experienced as a whole life that's going
badly-but j ust as a moment that feels sad. This shift in and of itself
will not necessarily make us feel better. But it may very well send us

58

down a different path, one that doesn't lead so inexorably to depres­
sion.

LIVING I N THE PRES ENT MOMENT

Jena's experience of eating the raisin illustrates how easily we get cata­
pulted into the mental time travel that keeps us from experiencing the
present moment as a moment and makes us stretch it into the past and
toward the future. Jena first tried the raisin exercise at the end of a
rather stressful day in which she had been rushing around trying unsuc­
cessfully to complete various proj ects. During the raisin exercise, her
mind reflected her day back to her:

My daughter had raisins for a snack yesterday . She didn't finish them .
And then she thought, I'm hungry , I haven't had my lunch yet. If Jed
hadn't interrupted me , I'd have had more time . I might even have had lunch.
She started to feel a little irritated, then her irritation faded as she
started to think about what she was going to cook for dinner. Next she
started to actually plan the dinner menu, and that brought her to won­
dering when the children would be home that day. Although her in­
tention was to focus on the sight and the touch and the smell and the
taste of the raisin in each moment, her mind actually wasn't there at
all. "Instead," she said, "it was thinking, thinking, thinking, all over
the place." And that thinking took her far away from the present mo­
ment and awareness of the raisin. She went back in time to her daugh­
ter's snack and to the interruption by Jed, then forward in time to the
dinner and her children returning home. This was not something Jena
chose to do. It was as if her mind j ust took off and played out its own
agenda.
During such mental time travel, we can easily forget that we are in
the present, as we get into thinking about past or future situations. In­
stead, we become absorbed within those ideas of past or future as if we
were actually there. We often relive remembered emotions or prelive
anticipated ones. Not only do we remove ourselves from the only real­
ity that we can directly experience, the here and now, but we also suffer

Cultivating Mindfu lness

59

the agonies of events that are either long past or may never actually
happen. No wonder we can end up feeling worse than we started out.
In the being mode of mind we learn we can inhabit the present
with a sense of spaciousness; there is no place else we need to be in this
very moment and nothing to do other than what is required in this mo­
ment. Our minds can be dedicated exclusively to awareness of now, al­
lowing us to be fully present with what life offers us in each moment.
This does not mean that we are forbidden from thinking about the past
or planning for the future; it only means that when we do think about
them, we are aware that we are doing so.

VIEWING THO U G HTS AS PASS ING
M ENTAL EVENTS

The tremendous power of the mind to think about things allows us to
solve problems mentally before we actually put the solutions into ac­
tion. It enables us to plan and imagine and write novels. The difficulty
occurs when we confuse the thoughts about things with the things

themselves. Thoughts involve interpretations and j udgments, which are
not in themselves facts; they are merely more thoughts.
The fact that we can be thinking about an imaginary chair in our
mind and know that it is not the same as the chair in which we are
seated in the living room is relatively easy to grasp. But when the mind
brings up ideas of things that aren't physically tangible to begin with­
such as our worth as individuals-the distinction can be much harder
to see. Ideas about our own self-worth are no more real than thoughts
about an imaginary chair. If we switch to being mode through mindful­
ness, we can see this much more clearly. We can learn to observe our
thoughts-and our feelings, for that matter-as experiences that come
and go in the mind. Just as the sound of a car on the street outside
passes, and the sight of a bird in the sky is momentary, the thoughts
that come to us are mental events that naturally arise, stay for a while,
and then fade of their own accord.
This ever-so simple, yet challenging, shift in the way we relate to

M O M E N T BY M O M EN T

60

thoughts releases us from their control. For when we have thoughts
such as "This unhappiness will always be with me" or "I am an unlov­
able person," we don't have to take them as realities. When we do, we
succumb to endlessly strugLiving in this moment and treating

gling with them. The reality
is that these ideas are mental
events akin to weather pat­
terns that our mind is gener­
ating for whatever reason in
this particular moment. If we
can see and accept them in
this way through mindful

awareness, we may eventually gain some insight into when and how
they appear. But in the meantime, we certainly don't have to treat
them as tyrants to be toppled.

TURNING OFF THE AUTO PILO T

After eating the raisin, many people realize how they hardly ever eat
mindfully. They become aware of a huge difference between the expe­
rience of this single raisin, approached mindfully, and what happens
when they normally eat.
Paula talked of the comparison with her normal experience of eat­
ing a raisin.
"Well, I wouldn't derive pleasure from it. I don't think I would be
even conscious of doing it. It wouldn't be something I would elect to
do, to go and eat a raisin; it would be part of something else. So eating
would just be something that I was meant to do at that time of the day,
rather than seen as something I could actually positively relish."
Unawareness pervades our lives. Eating is a prime example. Even
though it engages all our senses, we eat with almost no awareness. It's
possible to go for weeks on end, eating several times each day, and
never even taste our food. We may be eating and talking, eating and
reading, or simply eating while thinking of other things. We are fully

Cultivating Mindfulness

61

entangled i n the thought stream o f the mind and the pressing needs of
our daily lives.
Dieticians have suggested that eating this way is one reason some
of us end up overweight: we pay no attention to the body's signals of
satiation. Likewise, the patterns of the mind that get us
stuck in unhappiness and de­

memory and take control when
we're not fully awake and pres-

ent. We've passed the reins over to the automatic pilot in the mind,
creating the conditions in which these subconscious mechanisms can
operate freely.
We've all been on autopilot in everyday situations, and we all
know that it often takes us where we hadn't planned to go. Let's say we
have to deviate from our usual route home to deliver a package. What
happens if we drive on autopilot, daydreaming, problem solving, rumi­
nating ? Quite likely we'll find we still have the package in the car
when we get home. While our mind was elsewhere, the older habit of
following the well-worn route home took control. You've probably
laughed when you've discovered your grocery bag filled with every­
thing but the item you went out to get, or when you've found yourself
repeatedly dialing a number that changed some time ago, or when you
reached out to rub a smudge off your little boy's face, forgetting that
he's 2 7 .
Awareness keeps the old habits favored by the automatic pilot
from having the final say in determining our behavior. It even enables
us to spot them on the horizon and recognize them for what they are.
Ultimately we may even be able to view our ruminative thought pat­
terns with the same detached, self-compassionate amusement with
which we view the lapses that make us forget that our kids have grown
up, that our best friend has moved, or that we went shopping because
we needed milk. In doing mode our mind is so often preoccupied with

thoughts about what is going on that we may be only vaguely aware of

M O M E N T BY M O M E N T

62

what is actually happening in the present moment. By contrast, being
mode is characterized by awareness of immediate, sensory experience
of the present. We are in direct contact with life in each moment.
This fresh, direct intimacy with our experience is accompanied by
an entirely different way of knowing. It is an implicit, intuitive,
nonconceptual, direct knowing of what is unfolding as it is unfolding;
it is a knowing of what we are doing as we are doing it.
Without this awareness, we're stuck in a groove that gets deeper
the longer we tread that path. Our automatic thought patterns take us
down the same road over and over, and we respond with the same ac­
tions, which bring about the same worsening feelings-every part of
the anatomy of depression triggering the others and the whole. Lack of
awareness blinds us to other possibilities. In fact, it blinds us to change
in general.

EXPERIENCING THINGS DIRECTLY

Change Blindness
Psychologists Daniel Simons and Daniel Levin conducted an experi­
ment on how much people were aware of what was going on around
them as they were walking through the campus at Cornell University.
An experimenter carrying a campus map asked unsuspecting pedestri­
ans if they could give directions to a nearby building. Halfway through
the encounter the psychologists arranged for two people to walk be­
tween the questioner and the pedestrian while carrying a large door.
Thus, for a moment, the interviewer was hidden from view behind the
door. With practiced skill, at that very moment, a second questioner
took the place of the first one. Different person: different clothing, dif­
ferent height, different voice.
How many people being interviewed noticed the change ? Only
4 7 % in one study and only 3 3 % in a second study. Clearly, many of
these people were not aware of something that was happening right
in front of their eyes: the interviewer changed from one person to
another. How could this be ? When we're interrupted and given the

Cultivating Mindfulness

63

task of responding to a question that requires some problem solving,
we instantly lock on to the goal of solving the problem. As we said
at the beginning of this chapter, in doing mode the mind selects only
that information that is immediately relevant to attaining that goal.
Without being conscious of doing it at all, we screen out much of
what is available to our senses, even to the extent of not noticing at
all the person to whom we are speaking. Psychologists call this change

blindness.
Doing mode narrows our attention to the issues it is preoccupied
with, creating a veil of ideas that ordinarily keeps us out of touch with
direct experience. In the experiment j ust described, it was the narrow
focus of attention on only goal-relevant information that led to the
questioner's being seen simply as a generic "person asking me for direc­
tions" and therefore not really being seen at all. When we eat while
still operating in the doing mode, most of our attention is absorbed in
or colored by thinking related to achieving the goals set by the unfin­
ished business we seem to carry around with us all the time in the back­
ground of the mind: daydreaming, planning, problem solving, rehash­
ing, rehearsing. From the narrow goal focus of the doing mode, the
sights, smells, sensations, and tastes of eating are simply irrelevant and,
for that reason, given only scant attention. Most of us are unaware how
much of life we miss as a consequence.

Washing the Dishes
Have you noticed how often we mortgage our present moments for
some future promise ? Take washing the dishes, for instance. When we
are in the doing mode, we wash the dishes to get them done as soon as
possible so that we can get on to the next activity. Chances are, we are
also preoccupied with other things, so we don't give washing the dishes
our full attention. Perhaps we are hoping to have a moment to our­
selves at long last to relax. We may be thinking about having a cup of
coffee and how relaxing that will be. If we then come across a dirty pot
that we somehow missed ( or, even worse, someone else finds a dirty pot
that we have missed) , we might feel irritated because the offending pot

64

M O M EN T BY M O M EN T

has temporarily thwarted our desire to get finished as quickly as possi­
ble. Finally we do finish, and maybe we sit down for a moment to have
that cup of coffee. But our mind may still be very much locked into the
doing mode, preoccupied with its various plans and goals. So even
while drinking the coffee, it is very likely that we are already thinking
of the next task we have to do ( return some phone calls, catch up on
our e-mail, pay the bills, write a letter, run some errands, get back to
studying, whatever it may be ) .
For a moment, perhaps out of the blue, w e come to our senses and
are struck by the empty cup in our hand. Did I just drink that? I must

have . But I can't remember drinking it. We've actually missed the coffee
we had been anticipating sitting down to enj oy while we were doing
the dishes, j ust as we missed the whole range of sensory experience as­
sociated with washing the dishes: the feel of the water, the sight of the
bubbles, the sounds of the scrubber against the plate or bowl.
In this way, little by little, moment by moment, life can slip by
without us being fully here for it. Always preoccupied with getting
somewhere else, we are hardly ever where we actually are and attentive
to what is actually unfolding in this moment. We imagine we'll be
happy only when we get somewhere else, wherever and whenever that
may be. Then we'll have "time to relax." So we postpone our happi­
ness, rather than opening to the quality of the experience we're having
right now. As a consequence, we may miss the quality of the unfolding
moments in our day, j ust as we missed doing the dishes and drinking
the coffee. If we are not careful, we may actually miss most of our life in
this way.

B EYOND THE USUAL GOAL FOCUS
Doing mode is all about reaching preset goals, by focusing on the gap
between our ideas of where we are now and our ideas of where we want
to be. Being mode, by contrast, is not concerned with the gap between
how things are and how we want them to be. In principle at least, there

is no attachment to achieving any goal at all. This non-striving orien­
tation in itself helps to release us from the narrow goal focus of the do­
ing mode. It also has two very important further implications.
First, in being mode there is no need for constant monitoring
and evaluation to see whether the state of the world is approximating
our idea of the goal state we have set. This is reflected in the non­

judgmental , accepting quality of the way that we pay attention. In being
mode, we discover we can suspend evaluating our experience in terms
of how it "should" be or "ought" to be, of whether it is "correct" or "in­
correct," of whether it is "good enough" or "not good enough," or of
whether we are "succeeding" or "failing," even whether we are "feeling
good" or "feeling bad." Each present moment can be embraced as it is,
in its full depth, width, and richness, without a "hidden agenda" con­
stantly j udging how far our world falls short of our ideas of how we
need it to be. What a relief! But it is very important to be clear that,
when we let go of constantly evaluating our experience in this way, we
are not left to float, rudderless, without any purpose or aim to our ac­
tions. We can still act with intention and direction; compulsive, habit­
ual, unconscious doing is not the only source of motivation available to
us. For we can also take action in being mode. The difference is that we
are no longer so narrowly focused on, or attached to, our concepts
around our goals. This means that we may not be quite as upset or as

66

M O M E N T BY M O M EN T

paralyzed when reality does not conform to our expectations or to the
goals we have conceptualized, whatever they are. Alternatively, we
might in some moments be very, very upset and perhaps even para­
lyzed. Yet by allowing our awareness to include even those feelings,
that very gesture of awareness, as we shall see in the coming chapters,
brings with it new degrees of freedom that allow us to be with things as
they are { including how upset we are feeling} without having to have
them be different from how they actually are in this moment.
We have already hinted at a second profound implication of
bringing awareness to our endemic if unconscious attachment to goals
when we shift into the being mode. That is that we may no longer ex­
perience in the same way the entire range of unpleasant feelings and
emotions that are automatically generated whenever we focus on the
discrepancy between how we are feeling and how we want to feel.
When we shift from the doing mode to the being mode, the attendant
shift in our awareness can at a stroke cut through the source of much of
the additional unhappiness we experience when we are "making extra"
by becoming unhappy about our unhappiness, fearful of our fear, angry
with our anger, or frustrated with the failure of our attempts to think
our way out of our suffering. In this way we remove one of the primary
sources fueling the escalating cycles of dissatisfaction and depression to
which we may be vulnerable. No longer so constantly concerned with
what is wrong with our experience, we can open to the possibility of
feeling a greater sense of harmony and at-oneness with ourselves and
the world.
We've been taught that setting goals and working toward them is
the way to get where we want to go: to happiness. It may be difficult to
believe, then, that not clinging to goals, even worthy goals, may be the
way out of unhappiness. But now that we have seen how clinging to
the goal of "fixing" what we can so easily think of as our unworthy self
falsely draws us into the downward spiral of rumination and depression,
perhaps we can see how the non-striving orientation of mindfulness
might help us avoid that trap altogether. It allows us to refrain from
j udging and condemning our moods and trying to escape from emo­
tions we don't want to be feeling. As a result, we can "pull the plug" on

Cultivating Mindfulness

the habit of depressive rumination, and we have a chance to free our­
selves from its relentless pulL

APPROACHING I NS TEAD OF AVO IDING

Non-striving, as we said, does not mean floating around without a rud­
der. It means broadening our focus beyond what's needed to reach a
particular goaL It also means that instead of triggering fervent efforts to
rej ect the "unacceptable" emotions that pass through us, we meet them
with a sense of acceptance. But mindfulness is hardly passive resigna­
tion. It is a stance by which we intentionally welcome and turn toward
whatever arises-including inner experiences that we'd normally fight or
try to escape. Approach and avoidance mechanisms are fundamental
to all living systems and to the survival of the organism. Approach and
avoidance circuitry is wired into specific areas of the brain. Mindful­
ness embodies approach: interest, openness, curiosity ( from the Latin

curare, "to care for") , goodwill, and compassion. According to mindful­
ness teacher Christina Feldman:
The quality of mindfulness is not a neutral or blank presence. True mind­
fulness is imbued with warmth, compassion, and interest. In the light of
this engaged attention, we discover it is impossible to hate or fear any­
thing or anyone we truly understand. The nature of mindfulness is en­
gagement: where there is interest, a natural, unforced attention follows.

The openhearted approach attitude of mindfulness provides an
antidote to the instinctive avoidance that can fuel rumination. It gives
us a new way to relate to ourselves and the world, even in the face of
external threats and internal stress. By regaining intentional control of
our attention, we can rescue ourselves from becoming stuck in unhap­
piness and depression.
The raisin exercise offered a hint of what this intentional shift in
attention might feel like. What might happen if we extended the ap­
proach we took to eating a raisin to the activities of our everyday lives ?

MINDFULNESS OF RO UTINE ACTIVITIES

We want this new way of paying attention to be here for us when we
need it so we can respond skillfully to unhappiness and lead fuller,
richer, freer lives. How can we do this ? We begin by practicing deliber­
ately paying attention to our experience while carrying out previously
routine activities in our everyday lives in the same way that we did
with the raisin. We might begin by bringing mindfulness to one routine
activity per day.
The idea is to bring a gentle attentiveness to whatever we are do­
ing. As best we can, each time we do whatever it is, we bring a fresh
quality of deliberate moment-to-moment non-j udgmental awareness to
it. The aim is not to be hyperattentive or to bring greater strain or self­
consciousness to these routine actions. Actually, we may find that
bringing mindful awareness to things reduces effort and makes the cho­
sen activity easier.
It is interesting to notice how difficult it can be for us to do this
(apparently) simple thing. How do other people experience such an in­
tentional practice of the mundane ? Jena had practiced becoming more
aware of routine activities. What follows is her report of what hap­
pened over Thanksgiving. She expected the usual rush and chaos. To
compound matters, she was due to move into a new house in a few
weeks.
"Well," she said, "Thanksgiving was very hectic, plus the fact
that we're moving as well, but I coped surprisingly well. I used the
awareness in doing things. There were about eleven of us for five
days and everything was going on around me. So I focused on little
things that I did, perhaps peeling potatoes or cleaning up, I was more
aware of them. Like I focused in on the feel of the potato in my
hand as I peeled it.
"I coped with it all remarkably well, better than normal, consider­

ing it was more people than usual. I don't think I've ever coped quite so
well, to be honest."
What was it that Jena was doing differently ? It turns out that fo­
cusing on j ust this moment, no matter how apparently trivial the task,

B ring ing Awa reness to Routine Activities
One way to practice being more m indfu l is to choose some routine activ­
ity that we do every day, and resolve that each time we do it, we wi l l bring
a fresh quality of deliberate and gentle moment-to-moment awa reness to
the task or activity as best we ca n . Bringing awareness into these activi­
ties of daily living ca n make it much easier for us to recognize when we
a re operating in the doing mode, on a utomatic pilot, and provides us
with an insta nt a lternative, namely, an opportunity to enter and dwe l l i n

had benefits she had not counted on. For one thing, i t seemed to "pull
the plug" on her tendency to pre live the future. For another, it pre­
vented her mind from getting trapped in the doing mode that she had
previously used to avoid imagined catastrophes. This is how she de­
scribed it:
"I suppose the fact is that I didn't think of all the things that could
happen if I didn't do this or I didn't do that. I stayed in the present mo­
ment more than perhaps I would have done before. Usually, I'm always

70

MOMENT BY MOMENT

thinking ahead, Oh, what if this doesn't get done? What if I don't do this?
That seemed to have lessened, I think."
"I mean this moving-we've been in our house twenty years, and
you can't imagine the things we've got in the house. And for a few
nights, I couldn't sleep, thinking of all that's got to be done and I
thought, Well, no , take it as it comes . So that helped over Thanksgiving,
I think. I can't put it down to any other reason."
It was not that Jena had chosen to worry about what might go
wrong. It is j ust that, when our minds are elsewhere, when we are out
of touch with what is happening around us, old mental habits tend to
take over and control how we see and what we do from moment to mo­
ment. This can color our experience, shaping it below the level of our
awareness. We can often feel victimized without realizing that we are
actually collaborating in keeping the whole thing going.
As we've seen, slipping back into old patterns of thinking is the
primary pathway by which we become stuck in persistent unhappiness.
As in eating, washing the dishes, or getting through our to-do list, we
easily and mindlessly slip into daydreaming and problem solving. But
daydreaming is the first cousin of rumination. So if we've been de­
pressed for long periods in the past, there is a strong chance (particu­
larly when we're feeling unhappy) that our daydreams will slide into
well-worn habits of negative thinking. If we don't notice what is actu­
ally happening with us right here and right now, our mood may spiral
downward without our catching it. The first step to preventing this
from happening is to recognize when we are operating on autopilot and
to intentionally, as well as we can manage it, step out of it into a more
spacious, self-compassionate, and wiser awareness.

THE FRES H AIR OF AWARENESS

For most of us, a typical day involves hurrying from task to task, forget­
ting that there are other possibilities for us. Even a tiny bit of mindful­
ness, brought to any moment, can wake us up, thus subverting the mo­
mentum of doing for at least one moment-and that's all we need to be

Cultivating Mindfulness

71

concerned about. We don't have to stop what we are doing. We simply

bring greater momenHo-moment, non-judging, wise awareness to our un­
folding moments . The solution to our mood problems may not require
heroic attempts to change our inner feeling world or the outer world of
people, places, and j obs. Rather, it may simply involve a shift in the
way we pay attention to all of them.
If you have ever bought an old house, or know someone who has,
you'll know that dry rot is a maj or concern. If dry rot has got into the
wooden fabric of a house, it can be devastating. One of the recurring
themes of the surveyors who advise people on how to deal with it is
that air circulation is very important. Dry rot spores cannot survive
well where there is a fairly constant exposure to fresh air. A surveyor
will advise the buyer to install air-vents and other devices for keeping
the timber well ventilated. The spores are still around and may settle
on the wood, but with fresh air
around they will not thrive.
In a similar way, we could say
that stress, fatigue, and afflictive

with awareness, they cease to exist,
but that awareness puts more space around them, and such spacious­
ness, like fresh air to the spores, provides an environment in which the
self-diminishing and constricting frames of mind no longer thrive.
Mindfulness detects them earlier on, sees them more clearly, and no­
tices how they arise and can pass away. It offers us a way of seeing them
clearly without having to get caught in them. We don't usually inhabit
or even visit this dimension of our own minds, the dimension of aware­
ness itself, in spite of the fact that it is an intimate part of us. Although
it is a powerful capacity we all have, we mostly ignore it. In the chap­
ters that follow, we describe more ways to explore this new dimension
of our very own minds and hearts.

tions are profound. It shows us that we can transform experience j ust
by changing the way we pay attention. Using all the powers of aware­
ness available to us can break the chain of rumination and may j ust
free us from the cycle of chronic unhappiness. But tapping these pow­
ers requires skills that most of us don't have. This chapter and the rest
of Part II present mindfulness practices that have proven invaluable for
developing our capacity for recognizing when we're in doing mode and
for shifting into mindful awareness.

S TEADYING THE MIND

Cultivating the ability to shift modes requires that we learn how we
can be fully present right here, right now, whatever the "here and now"
presents to us. Sounds good, except for one thing. Much of the time, if
things are not going "our way," we don't really want to be in the pres­
ent moment: we want to be somewhere else, anywhere else. What is
more, much of the time it is not so easy to focus our attention on the
present moment, even when we attempt it. Our minds tend to be all
over the place, leaping chaotically from topic to topic like monkeys
leaping from tree to tree through the j ungle.

How often have you left one room in your house in search of scis­
sors or the phone book and found yourself in another room without
any idea what you came in for? How often have you laughed at a j oke,
thought to share it with a friend, and then, a mere minute or two
later, found yourself thinking about the missing check from the
checkbook-without any idea how one thought led to the other? The
mind seems to have a mind of its own.
Simply waking up to that fact can be an important discovery. But
then what do we do ? How can we train the mind to be less scattered
and more "present," even when it is at the mercy of so many distrac­
tions, even in the face of strongly unpleasant circumstances or stress ?
How do we stabilize and deepen our capacity for paying attention ?
We do so by choosing where and how we pay attention. And for
this strategy to be effective, we will also need to develop a certain de­
gree of motivation and a particular kind of intentionality so we are not
perpetually at the mercy of the mind's ingrained habits of reactivity.
But j ust trying harder isn't the issue, as we will see in the following tale.

The Novice
In a time-honored story set in an ancient Himalayan kingdom, a nov­
ice monk was excited at the prospect of meeting his teacher for the first
time. He was on fire with questions but sensed that this was not the
time to ask them. Instead, he listened carefully to the teacher's instruc­
tions. They were brief and to the point. "Get up early tomorrow and
climb to a cave you'll find at the top of this mountain. Sit from dawn to
dusk and have no thoughts. Use any method you wish to banish
thought. When the day is over, come and tell me how it went."
At dawn the next day the novice found the cave, made himself
comfortable, and waited for his mind to settle. He thought that if he
sat long enough it would become blank. Instead, his mind was crowded
with thoughts. Soon he started to worry about failing the task he had
been set. He tried to force the thoughts out of his mind, but that just
produced more thoughts. He shouted at them to "Go away," but the
words echoed noisily in the cave. He j umped up and down, held his

74

MOMENT BY MOMENT

breath, shook his head. Nothing seemed to work. He'd never known
such a bombardment of thoughts in his life.
At the end of the day he climbed back down, completely dispir­
ited, wondering what his teacher's response would be. Perhaps he'd be
dismissed as a failure, unsuitable for further training. But the teacher
j ust burst out laughing at the tale of his mental and physical gymnas­
tics. "Very good ! You have tried really hard and done well. Tomorrow
you should go back to the cave. Sit from dawn to dusk having nothing
but thoughts. Think of anything you like all day long, but allow no
gaps to occur between your thoughts. "
The novice was really pleased. This would b e easy. H e was bound
to succeed. After all, "having thoughts" is what had been happening to
him all day.
The next day saw him climbing with confidence up to his cave
and taking his seat. After a little while he realized that all was not well.
His thoughts started to slow down. Occasionally, a pleasant thought
would come to mind and he would decide to follow it for a while. But
soon it dried up. He tried to think grand thoughts, philosophical specu­
lations, to worry about the state of the universe. Anything. He started
to run low on things to think about and even got a little bored. Where
had all his thinking gone ? Soon the "best" thoughts he could get
seemed a little worn, like an old coat that had become threadbare.
Then he noticed gaps in his thinking. Oh dear, this was what he had
been told to avoid. Another failure.
At the end of the day he felt pretty wretched. He'd failed again.
He climbed down the mountain and went to find his teacher, who
burst out laughing again. "Congratulations ! Wonderful! Now you
know how to practice perfectly." He didn't understand why the teacher
was so pleased. What on earth had he learned ?
The teacher was pleased because the novice was now ready to rec­
ognize something of real significance: You cannot force the mind. And if

you try to , you won't like what comes of it.
There is no need to climb to the top of a mountain to come to this
important conclusion on your own. You might like to try this simple
experiment right now. Look away from the book for a minute and

The Breath

75

think of anything you like, but try not to think of a white bear. One min­
ute. Make sure that no thought or image of that animal occurs to you.
Has the minute passed ? What did you find ?
Most people find they can't completely suppress thoughts of white
bears. Professor Daniel Wegner and colleagues have shown that when
we try to suppress thoughts like this, what we resist persists: our attempts
to force the mind can rebound in exactly the opposite direction from
the one we want. Not only is it difficult to suppress the thought in the
first place, but later, if we're allowed to think of white bears, the
thought of them comes up more often than if we had not been trying to
suppress them earlier.
If this is true for neutral thoughts and images such as bears, it's not
difficult to imagine what happens when we try to suppress negative
thoughts, images, and memories of a very personal nature. If we've ex­
perienced persistent low mood in the past, we are likely to put a lot of
mental effort into keeping negative thinking at bay. Research by
Drs. Wenzlaff, Bates, and associates shows that this can work for a lit­
tle while-but at a huge cost: those who put more effort into keep­
ing negatives out of mind end up being more depressed than those
who do not. From such research, many psychologists have confirmed
the conclusion long suggested by meditative wisdom: trying to suppress unwanted

bilize and clear our minds.

When Intention Works Better Than Force
How can we possibly steady and calm the mind if force is so ineffec­
tive ?
All is not lost. Have you ever seen an infant studying her own
hand, totally absorbed in exploring this wondrous creation of nature ?
Her attention can be sustained, apparently effortlessly, for minutes at a
time. The mind has a natural mechanism for supporting sustained, vig­
ilant, engaged attention. How do we tap into it?
One way is to give ourselves the gentle challenge of intentionally

MOMENT BY MOMENT

76

focusing and refocusing our attention on a single obj ect. Historically,
many different obj ects of attention have been used to gather and
steady the mind in this way, from a gently flickering candle flame to a
sound such as "om" repeated silently in the mind. Research has re­
vealed that intentionally focusing on j ust one obj ect in this way can
steady the mind by activating the brain networks corresponding to the
chosen focus of attention and, at the same time, inhibiting the brain
networks corresponding to competing demands for attention, without
any need for force. It's as if the brain "lights up" the selected obj ect
while also "dimming" the unselected obj ects.
To take advantage of these basic processes, these natural tenden­
cies of the mind/brain to settle under certain circumstances, we do ac­
tually need to make an effort-but it is a certain kind of gentle effort.
We direct the spotlight of our attention onto our chosen object and
then refocus the spotlight on the obj ect over and over again, whenever
we notice it has drifted away. This is very different from the goal­
oriented striving that tries to steady the mind by forcing certain
thoughts into the mind, by pushing other thoughts out, or by erecting a
barrier to the entry of unwanted thoughts and feelings. It is a graceful
and gentle kind of effort that signals a shift to a mental mode that sup­
ports curiosity, interest, and a tendency to explore and investigate. It is
tapping into the mind's capacity to approach rather than avoid situa­
tions, as we saw in Chapter 3 .
Traditionally, this harnessing of the mind's own natural capacities
for calm and clarity is nicely captured by the image of a glass of muddy
water. As long as we keep stirring the water, it will stay opaque and
cloudy. But if we have the patience to simply wait, the mud will even­
tually settle at the bottom of the glass, leaving clear, pure water above.
In the same way, our attempts to steady, calm, or control our mind of­
ten merely stir things up and make everything less clear. But we can get
out of our own way and stop contributing to the cloudiness of the mind
by encouraging it to alight and dwell on a single obj ect of attention for
a time. When we intentionally let go of our urge to force things to be a
particular way, the mind naturally settles all by itself, leaving us both
calmer and clearer.

The Breath

77

It's important t o select a relatively neutral obj ect as the chosen fo­
cus of attention. The obj ect should not be so emotionally charged or
intellectually interesting that it disrupts the development of mental
steadiness. From ancient times, the breath has served as a convenient
object for this purpose. The intention is to attend as best we can to the
constantly changing pattern of physical sensations as the breath moves
in and out of the body.

THE B REATH

You might like to try this first mindfulness-of-breathing practice now if
you're in a position to lie down briefly. If not, try it a little later.

Mindfu l n e ss of B reath ing-Lying Down
To get in touch with you r breath moving in the body rig ht now, lie down
on you r back and place one hand over you r belly (in the reg ion of the na­
vel ) . You may notice that i n this position the abdominal wa l l rises with the
i n-breath and fa l l s with the out-breath . See if you can pick up on and feel
this movement, first with you r hand, then without you r hand, just by
"putti ng you r mind in you r belly. " There is no need to control the flow of
the breath . Allow it to come and go as it wil l , sensing as best you can the
changing pattern of physica l sensations. Rest here i n awa reness, with the
feeling of the breath moving i n the body i n this way, or however you fi nd
the movement of the belly to be with you r own breathing .

You can also cultivate mindfulness of breathing in a sitting posi­
tion. Guidance for this practice is given on Track 4 of the CD accom­
panying this book and on the next two pages.
It's remarkable and inspiring to think that the practice of focusing
on the breath in this way has been followed, somewhere in the world,
every day for at least the last 2,500 years. It provides a wonderful foun­
dation for the practice of meditation. Our breathing is with us wher­
ever we go (we can't leave home without it ! ) ; no matter what we are

an in-breath and the fol lowi ng out-breath and between an out-breath
and the fol lowi ng in-breath . As an a lternative, if you prefer, focus on a

okay. This wandering and getting a bsorbed in things is sim ply what minds

doing, feeling, or experiencing, it is always available to help us to re­
connect our attention to the present moment.
Learning to focus, refocus, and refocus our attention on the breath
offers a wonderful way to learn how we can be fully present right here,
right now, in an instant, at any time, with whatever the "here and
now" presents to us. Because we can attend to the movements of the
breath only in the very moment in which they are arising, attending to
the breath holds us in the present and provides a vital anchor line with
which we can reconnect to the here and now when we recognize that
our mind has traveled far away, to the "there and then."
Maintaining a focus of awareness on the breath as the mind is
pulled away by thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations, or external dis­
tractions is not easy. But it may seem less of a struggle when we are able
to see such fluctuations in the mind as j ust "what the mind does"­
similar to waves on the surface of water. If we see these "mind waves" as
both natural and inevitable, then the very going away and coming
back of our attention can be seen as the heart of the practice, not a
lapse or a deviation or a distraction from it. For such goings and com­
ings can teach us precisely what we need to learn: to recognize when we
have drifted into doing mode, to disengage from any doing, and to enter
and dwell in being.

Discovering Unexpected Calm
Vince found that focusing on the breath had a wonderfully calming ef­
fect on him the first time he tried it. His mind settled, and he felt
calmer than he had in ages. He decided that he would get into the
habit of repeating the same practice each lunchtime at work. Each day,
he closed his office door and practiced along with his meditation CD.
Not only Vince, but the wider world noticed the difference.
"For some time, my boss has been concerned about how stressed
I've seemed," he reflected, "saying to me when she sees me, 'You okay ?
Do you feel all right?' Now, after I have done the practice at lunchtime
at work, I feel a lot more relaxed. Yesterday at lunchtime when I
opened my door and started work again, the boss popped her head

The Breath

81

around the door and asked how I was feeling. I said I was feeling okay.
'And I'll tell you this,' she said, 'I can't count the number of people
who've come into my office for something and said, 'Vince seems a lot
happier in the afternoons. '
"I d o interact with a lot o f people i n m y j ob-people that I need to
see about various things. And they've noticed in the afternoons I'm a
lot more relaxed and happier. I feel really good about that, because I
feel like it when I 'come back' after lunch, but I hadn't realized that it
was actually sort of coming out. I knew how I was feeling, but I hadn't
realized that everyone else was noticing it as well."
So what was the difference Vince noticed ?
"What I notice is that, if I am in a conversation with someone, or
a group of people, and I am getting wound up, I can be aware of the
breathing, yet carry on the conversation. Like we could be talking j ust
as we are now, and if I get wound up, I sort of bring the breathing into
awareness; the breath is here; and it j ust helps to calm me."
It was not that Vince was trying to be a nicer person or to impress
everyone at work. It seemed to be a by-product of his making time at
lunch to simply sit quietly and focus on his breath. During these peri­
ods of formal mindfulness practice, he had experienced something very
important, namely, the inherent tendency of the mind to settle once
we let go of our attempts to make ourselves feel a particular way. He
was finding that this simple practice was then enabling him to deal
with situations differently at other times as well and to respond
intentionally rather than to react automatically. He had been learning
the difference between allowing
the mind to settle and trying to
force it to settle.

discovered countless times by
others over the ages. It has two very important implications. First, it
gives us a skillful and effective way to let the mind settle into this natu­
ral, if unfamiliar, condition. Second, it shows us that a capacity for in-

82

MOMENT BY MOMENT

ner calm and peace is already within each of us and always available.
We don't have to do anything special to attain or deserve this particu­
lar state of mind-all we have to do is stop getting in our own way, to
stop stirring up the mind and making it opaque and cloudy. Amazingly,
this inner calm and happiness within each one of us doesn't depend on
the fortunes and misfortunes that life delivers. It is always here for us to
tap into once we have a reliable method for doing so. This can lead to
a greater sense of balance and equanimity in the face of the highs and
the lows, the pleasures and the pains, that are an inevitable part of life.
This is akin to experiencing an innate and genuine capacity for
happiness-for yourself and for others-one that doesn't depend en­
tirely on things always going a certain way or on getting the result we
think we need. Not that it is easy to remember this innate capacity and
connect with it. That takes training of a certain kind.

Dealing with the Wandering Mind
Katrina was becoming discouraged. She had hoped that the breathing
meditation would bring her peace and quiet and escape from a busy
mind, yet it didn't tum out like that. "I've been thinking of a thousand
and one other things," she reported. "It's very difficult to stop myself
from going into the future, thinking about things. I try to control it,
and maybe it works for two minutes, but then I go off again."
Katrina ended up in a battle for control of the mind, one of the
most common early reactions to meditation practice. Letting go of our
attachment to the habit-driven doing mode of mind can feel both un­
familiar and artificial. We are so used to the speed and busyness of our
lives that when we deliberately slow things down and give ourselves
j ust one thing to focus on, something in us rebels. When we begin a
period of formal practice, either lying down or sitting, sooner or later­
usually sooner-we discover that our mind has a life of its own and
that, regardless of our determination to keep it focused on the breath or
any other obj ect, it will wander away into various thoughts, often
about the future or the past.
This tendency of the mind to wander is perfectly normal. The fact

The Breath

83

that our thoughts seem to proliferate without end doesn't at all reflect
an inability to meditate on our part, even though it can be somewhat
demoralizing at first to discover this attribute of our own mind. In fact,
this recognition of the ever-changing nature of our own thought
stream and how labile our attention is marks the beginning of medita­
tive awareness. All the same, it is very easy to become fidgety in the
face of the unrelenting torrent of thoughts and think that we must be
doing something wrong. We might wind up telling ourselves that noth­
ing useful or interesting seems to be happening; the mind is j ust wan­
dering uncontrollably, even as we persist in bringing it back over and
over again to a sense of the breath moving in the body, or whatever our
primary focus of attention may be. "How boring," the mind says to it­
self.
It's only natural to think that the work of meditation is being in­
terrupted when the mind wanders here, there, and everywhere. Yet it is
actually at this point that the meditation practice becomes really inter­
esting and vital. Each moment in which the mind takes off gives us one
more opportunity to become more aware of when we are slipping (or
have already slipped) out of the being mode and back into the doing
mode. It allows us to become more aware of the thoughts, feelings, and
body sensations that carry us away in those moments. Happily, such oc­
casions happen so often that we will have countless opportunities to
witness the seething pressure of the doing mind, perhaps perceiving it
with greater clarity than ever before, uncomfortable as that may some­
times be. These occasions also provide us, crucially, with valuable op­
portunities to cultivate the skills of releasing ourselves from the doing
mode and returning to the more mindful being mode.
This is why the instructions for the mindfulness-of-breathing
practice encourage us to congratulate ourselves at first when we notice
our awareness is no longer on the breath. In that very moment, it can
be helpful to note briefly what is on our mind and name what is going
on ( for example, "thinking, thinking," or "planning, planning," or
"worrying, worrying") . Whatever the content of the thought or impulse, the

task is the same: to note what is on our mind in this moment and then
to gently escort our awareness back to our breathing, renewing our

M O M E N T BY M O M E N T

84

contact with the in-breath or the out-breath, whichever is happening
when we come back.
At this point, we may find ourselves j udging our experience quite
harshly because we may feel so frustrated or thwarted in our efforts.

Why can't I do this better? we may say to ourselves. In such moments, it
helps if we can remember to bring a quality of kindness even to this
awareness, seeing that these self-critical and j udgmental thoughts and
feelings are just more thoughts and feelings, like any others, j ust old
and ingrained weather patterns in the mind and of no particular import
or significance. Nor are they accurate. But their presence can be seen
as providing multiple opportunities and reminders for us to bring pa­
tience, gentle acceptance, and openness to our experience. And why
not do so, since our experience is already as it is ? Being harsh with our­
selves because we don't like how it is is adding something extra and is
unnecessary. Our j udging, if not held in awareness in this way, may be
exactly what is preventing us from seeing clearly in this moment and
from being okay with things as they are.

Turning Discovery into Expectations
Just like anything else, meditation can all too easily be taken on in a
doing mode of mind. Perhaps having experienced the turbulence in the
mind abating a bit on its own on a few occasions, we may find ourselves
expecting it to happen every time we sit down to meditate. If a time
comes when we don't feel so settled, we might feel disappointed and
frustrated. At some level we may know that putting aside our expecta­
tions would be much more effective, yet we can't help asking ourselves,

If we experienced calmness last time , why not now? Unwittingly, we have
slipped into becoming goal-oriented in the meditation practice. Then
we may wind up feeling even more strongly that we aren't making any
headway with all this meditation practice, that we are right back at
square one.
"Sometimes I can get really irritated with it," said Paula. "I do my
meditation when I come home from work. I usually feel very positive

The Breath

85

about the whole thing, but sometimes I can get so restless, you know, I
can get really irritated."
What is actually going on with Paula ? Well, first, there is the rest­
lessness itself. This is a bundle of body sensations accompanied by an
internal "feeling." But then along comes something else, something ex­
tra: irritation. How had she handled this when it came up ? "I tried just
to let it be and do what we're doing-j ust coming back to the breath.
Part of it was good, you know. But then I started feeling restless and ir­
ritated again."
Irritation is closely associated with frustration, and frustration
arises when an expectation or a goal is thwarted. Where had Paula's
goal come from ?
"Parts o f i t j ust felt wonderful," she said o f the practice. "I could
get it in snatches, as if I was really here, and then at other times I could
feel the irritation."
Without realizing it, Paula had set a goal of "feeling good" while
doing the practice. It's very common to have a feeling that we've "got
it" in certain moments, that "this" must be what I am really supposed
to be feeling, only to feel at other moments like we've "lost it," maybe
even in the very next moment. This too is a very common experience
when beginning a meditation practice, and not a problem at all, espe­
cially if we can be aware of it and smile inwardly at the unending antics
of our own doing mind. But once we have felt a sense of peace, even for
the briefest of moments during a session of practice, the doing mind's
habitual tendency to look for goals naturally kicks in and generates
the expectation or hope that we will have the same experience in the
next moment or the next time we
do the practice. And if that expe­

ourselves for getting irritated. The gyrations of the j udging mind are
truly endless, and so off-base from simply accepting things as they are.
We may even wind up thinking that experienced meditators never feel
irritated, as we generate endless fantasies and idealizations about medi­
tation.
So if irritation arises in any moment, it may be helpful not to take
the route of j udgment and fantasy, but rather simply to note it as "irri­
tation," labeling it as a way of acknowledging it for what it is. Then we
can gently redirect our attention back to the breath.
Our expectations of "what we ought to be feeling" will habitually
and automatically rear their old, familiar heads and, on occasion, in
our unawareness, cause us to feel frustrated. The challenge in such mo­
ments is simply to note the "coulda, shoulda, woulda, oughta" thoughts
with friendly interest as old acquaintances. We can simply recognize
them as "thinking" or "j udging" or "berating" and return our attention
to the breath.
Over time these goal-driven mind states will become more famil­
iar and less of an enemy or an obstacle. Although the sense of struggle
can come back with exasperating regularity, gradually our recognition
of such antics becomes more of a friendly reminder of j ust how much
power the doing mode exerts over our lives, and even our thoughts and
feelings and motivations. Rather than a reason to despair, however,
such goal-driven and j udgmental mind states can be treated as cues, re­
minding us of how easy it is to get caught in difficult emotions around
"getting somewhere" or "making progress." This is how we eventually
learn to view our thoughts and feelings as j ust thoughts and feelings, as
described in Chapter 2-and come to see that they are usually neither
particularly accurate nor helpful.

Accepting Mind Wandering and Starting Over
When practicing mindfulness, if we slip back into the doing mind-set,
thinking that the meditation is "not working" or that we are "doing it
wrong," it can be very helpful to remind ourselves that cultivating
mindfulness of breathing, or any other obj ect of attention, is funda-

mentally a practice of beginning again, and again, and again each time
we are caught up and carried away by the wanderings of the mind.
"I can see that my mind wanders away," said Vince. "It can last
some time before I realize what is happening. What I used to do is get
angry and frustrated about it. Now I tend to notice that the mind drifts
around quite a bit.
"Now I tend to let the thoughts drift past, and if I can bring myself
back even a little, the thoughts don't bother me so much. They used to
be really intense, whereas now they're sort of j ust floating around."
Vince has learned to notice the drifting and bring his attention
back to the breath without giving himself a hard time about it. He has
stopped getting so frustrated by the
fact that his attention tends to get hi­
j acked by his various thoughts. Not
that it doesn't continue to happen.
But learning to witness this whole

process without reacting to it so automatically has allowed him to refo­
cus on the sensations of breathing much more reliably than when he is
caught up in being self-judgmental.
Much of the struggle with the practice comes j ust at the moment
when we are already back in the present moment and realize that the
mind has been absorbed in wandering. But this moment is also a major
opportunity for learning. Through repeated practice we see over and
over again that each in-breath is a new beginning and each out-breath
a fresh letting go. We begin to see that the shift from one mode of
mind to another can be virtually instantaneous. In this way the prac­
tice is always giving us the chance to begin again, in this moment, with
this breath. If our mind wanders 1 00 times during a period of formal
practice, then we simply, and good-naturedly, bring it back 1 00 times.
This is what Vince was reporting about his experience.
Eventually we may come to see what this practice is actually ask­
ing of us: to recognize and accept that our mind does indeed have a life
of its own and that it will inevitably wander away from whatever obj ect
of attention we set for ourselves-in this case, the breath. And we may
come to see that we can gently escort our attention back to the breath
every time this happens. Ultimately, we come to see that we can cradle
all of it in awareness with a light and gentle touch, including the wan­
dering of the mind, with all its obsessions and its struggles. Just that.
And that is a lot, perhaps everything. We may come to realize that our
moments of greatest struggle can be our moments of greatest learning.
In the moment of beginning again, even when we've been struggling,
we may experience a fleeting sense of j oy, a feeling perhaps of coming
home or of recognizing an old friend. Such experiences can awaken our
curiosity and our sense of adventure and keep us practicing when part
of us feels like giving up.

Letting Be, Allowing: Giving Up Control
Suzanne found it hard to focus on the breath without trying to control
it: "I find that I'm trying to conttol my breath to make it slower. I'm

The Breath

89

thinking all the time about whether it is right. It doesn't feel to me like
natural breathing."
Trying to control the breathing is not an uncommon experience
in the early stages of meditation practice. But again, the body knows
how to breathe j ust fine on its own. In fact the breath does what it has
to do perfectly . . . until the thinking, doubting, striving mind gets in­
volved. Then we find it terribly difficult to ease up on ourselves and let
go of our expectations of how things "should be." We find it difficult to
trust that, left to itself, the breath will sort itself out.
Eventually Suzanne realized that she did not have to try to slow
down her breathing, that she did not have to do anything different­
that, in fact, she didn't have to do anything at all. She began to focus
on the sensations that go along with breathing, instead of trying to
control the breath to make something happen.
"I quite enjoy it now," she said. "I used to try to consciously con­
trol it all: to control this and control that or control the breathing.
Then I found in the end it became easier to let the breathing j ust hap­
pen and to bring myself back when it wandered. If you are not getting
wound up in some thought pattern, it's easier."
There is no particular state we need to achieve when practicing
mindfulness of breathing-the idea is simply to allow the experience of
each moment to be j ust as it is without requiring that it be any other
way. In other words, to be aware and to settle into and dwell in that
awareness.

Taking It Breath by Breath: Only This Moment
Focusing on the sensations of breathing as one breath follows another
teaches us how to take one thing at a time and be in one moment at a
time. In everyday life we encounter many situations where we tend to
anticipate the future. It is like facing a pile of logs that has to be moved
from the front of the house, where the logs have been delivered, to the
back. If we look at the whole pile, our heart sinks, our energy may fail,
and the TV will suddenly seem more attractive than it had before. But

90

MOMENT BY MOMENT

we also know that if we are able to focus on the one log we've got to
move in this moment, and give our full attention to that, and then
take on the next one, all of a sudden the chore becomes doable. The
point is not simply to fool ourselves into pretending the pile is not
large, but to explore the possibility that we can enter a different mode
of mind, a mode in which we attend to the quality of the present mo­
ment, rather than anticipating how exhausted we may feel at the end.
The pile-of-logs effect applies to much of our lives. We often ex­
haust ourselves by focusing on all the things we have to do, not j ust for
this day, but for the weeks or the months ahead. We carry a burden that
doesn't need to be carried. When we deliberately tune in to j ust this
moment, to what is before us right now, we allow the energy to come
through to complete j ust this moment's task.

MINDFUL WALKING

Nearly all the practices described in this book include a deliberate fo­
cusing of attention in the present moment, on one aspect of our experi­
ence or another. In that way these practices help steady the mind as we
cultivate mindful awareness. Indeed, some steadiness is essential when­
ever we wish to relate to our experience with greater clarity and aware­
ness. But there may be times when our minds are too agitated or driven
to focus effectively on the breath while the body is sitting or lying still.
At such times it can be invaluable to tum to another equally familiar
aspect of everyday experience: the sensations in the body as we walk.
Since ancient times, mindful walking has been used in tandem with
mindful breathing. It is also a wonderful meditation practice in its own
right.
You may already be familiar with how a meditation that involves
moving, like mindful walking, can shift us from one mental mode to
another. Tai chi, chi gung, and hatha yoga are all moving meditations.
Perhaps for you walking the dog or going out for a run has been a good
way to "clear your head" when you're stuck in a vicious mental circle
while trying to come up with a creative idea. Or perhaps you can recall

The Breath

91

how dancing a t a weekend party had you feeling fully alive i n that mo­
ment, relieved of the cumulative burden of the past week's problems.
Or maybe you j ust know that doing something physical when you're
upset helps you "let off steam" and avoid being sucked into endless
brooding. All of these physical activities are in themselves potential
mindfulness practices, when they are engaged in with awareness and an
intentional shift in attention. Walking meditation is a powerful way to
cultivate mindfulness while moving, as we shall see in the next exer­
cise.
There are many different ways to practice mindful walking and
many different places where we can allow our attention to settle and
return to when it goes off. One is to focus attention on the sensations
associated with the feet moving during walking and especially with the
moments of contact with the floor or ground. You might want to take
some time to practice this now, after reading the instructions that fol­
low. Or you might want to try it at some other point in time.

Learning from Walking
Walking practice turns out to be especially useful when we feel agitated
and unable to settle or when we j ust can't sit still any longer. The phys­
ical sensations of walking can also help us to feel more grounded emo­
tionally in difficult times than we might feel in the sitting meditation
practice. Mindful walking has been described as "meditation in mo­
tion." The invitation is to be, and be mindful, with every step, to walk
for its own sake, without any destination. The absence of a destination
or goal builds on the same theme as when we begin over and over again
with each in-breath and each out-breath: it reminds us that there are
alternatives to modes of mind that are centered on doing, in which we
always have to be getting somewhere. The simple walking back and
forth along the same path embodies the theme of "nowhere to go,

94

nothing to do, nothing to attain." I t is simply being here fully in this
moment, with this step.
"I like the walking meditation," explained Suzanne, "because I
can be conscious of it when I leave work. I have to pick up the kids,
and sometimes I'm marching up the path to get to schooL I often find I
am stomping and marching because I'm in a rush and getting a bit
stressed. Sometimes now I'll be aware of it, and I'll walk more slowly
and, you know, breathe with the steps. So by the time I actually get to
the kids waiting at the top of the path, I'm composed."
Of course, once Suzanne had shifted into walking with awareness,
she could have marched, or even stomped, with full awareness. But
slowing the body did help to settle things for her. Sometimes she found
it helped to sit in the car for a moment or two and j ust be aware of her
breathing before getting out to pick up the kids:
"You end up with your mind sort of whizzing round, and then your
activity goes up and, you know, your body is whizzing around. If I slow
down, everything else slows down and I become more aware of what's
going on. And what might j ust take me ten seconds to get to the top of
the path is then thirty or forty seconds, which is well worth it. It does­
n't matter if I am a few seconds late. When you become aware of time,
I think, one minute can be a very, very long time, when you want it to
be."
Suzanne's experience shows how we may use any small moments
to be mindfuL For her, mindful walking helped to transfer what she was
learning from her quieter, more regular mindfulness practice at home
to the hurly-burly of everyday life.

FROM UNAWARENESS TO AWARENESS

The novice we met in the story earlier in this chapter had tried to con­
trol his mind, first by emptying it of thoughts, then by filling it with
thoughts. Focusing on either goal and j udging how close he was getting
to achieving it meant he had no peace. We practice sitting with the
breath or walking mindfully to help us become more aware, not as a

The Breath

strategy to clear the mind of thought or anything else. Clarity and
steadiness of the mind may follow as by-products of such awareness and
from allowing things to be as they are, but if we take momentary calm­
ness as a sign of how much progress we are making and momentary
restlessness as a sign of lack of progress, we are merely sowing the seeds
of further frustration and despair, for we are letting the doing mind
compare our "achievement" with some desired "outcome." As long as
we are trying to get rid of unpleasant thoughts or feelings or trying to
achieve peace of mind, we will continue to be frustrated.
The intention in mindfulness practice is not to forcibly control
the mind but to perceive clearly its healthy and harmful patterns. It is
to approach our minds and bodies with a sense of curiosity, openness,
and acceptance so that we may see what is here to be discovered, and
be with it without so much struggling. In this way, little by little, we
begin to release ourselves from the grip of our old habits of mind. We
begin to know directly what we are doing as we are doing it. We are be­
ginning a graceful transition from unawareness to awareness.

emotional states for good reason. The body and its infinite sensations
are the repository of and the messengers for emotion. Joy, pleasure, or
amusement can actually feel something like a tickle. Of course, the
heart doesn't move around in the body when we feel "uplifted" or
"beaten down," but some real physical sensations occur that are cap­
tured by those descriptions. Nor does the heart stop when we're
shocked or frightened, but the emotional signal is so strong that we
may momentarily feel like it has.
The point is that the body has a lot to tell us about how we are
feeling, not j ust at peak moments but all the time. Yet we often don't
hear its messages with any degree of wisdom, because we are too busy
reacting to them in ways that immediately trigger a cascade of thoughts

96

and j udgments. The challenge here is whether we can, in the being
mode, actually open to, know, and befriend the very sensations and
feelings we are experiencing in the body, whatever they may be, and
accept them with a new receptivity because they are actually part of
the sensory landscape of our own body in this moment. If we can listen
with this kind of openness, we will discover powerful new ways to be

with what we are experiencing in any moment, whether it is pleasant,
unpleasant, or neutral.
"I feel the weight of the world on my shoulders," we sometimes
say. We may be more familiar with that sensation than many others­
and certainly more often than we'd like. This is how many of us feel
when depressed or unhappy-as if a huge burden has been placed on
the body, making every normal action an effort. In Chapter 1 we talked
about the importance of the body in the anatomy of depression.
Through the raisin exercise and mindful walking, perhaps you've had a
chance to see how out of touch we can be with our direct sensory expe­
rience, including the body's various messages. A rich and varied land­
scape is available to us when we open to these aspects of the present
moment, grounded in the body itself, and not simply carried away by
the mind's reactions in thought and emotion.
As we discussed earlier, physical sensations, thoughts, feelings,
and behavior all work together to create a state of depression. Let's
focus for a moment on the way that sensations in the body can
trigger negative thinking. Consider how you might feel upon wak­
ing up when you've been feeling down for a stretch of time. Perhaps
the first thing you notice is how heavy and achy your body is.
Maybe you don't even feel rested after a night's sleep. Your energy
level is so low that you actually feel more tired than when you went
to bed the night before. Maybe this has been happening to you a lot
lately.
In addition to these sensory aspects of your experience, thoughts
like I don't think I'm going

to

get anything done today or Another wasted

day may waft through your mind. Perhaps such thoughts lead you to
feel frustrated and sad, disappointed with yourself. Eventually you try

98

M O M E N T BY M O M EN T

to get out of bed but feel so heavy and tired that you drop back from
the very effort. Maybe you try to put the thoughts of how listless you
feel out of your mind. You certainly don't want to feel like this. You're
fed up with these daily battles with lack of energy. I've got to get up and

get going; this is doing me no good at all, you might hear yourself say.
When you finally do get up, the listless feeling passes as you busy your­
self with the day's activities. But these morning struggles seem to be an
increasing burden.
In Chapter 1 we talked about how physical sensations, thoughts,
feelings, and behavior can coalesce in the downward spiral of depres­
sion. If we look more closely at what is happening in the preceding
scenario, we can see that if the morning starts with sensations of
physical sluggishness, then thoughts about this sluggishness may sur­
face along with emotional reactions. The effects of these emotions in
the body only strengthen the sense of physical heaviness. This sce­
nario illustrates how easily we can get trapped in a cycle in which
our thoughts about our body sensations can drag us down into de­
pression.
But what if we could open ourselves to the full panoply of direct
sensory experience instead of simply getting carried away by the mind's
reactions in thought and emotion? We've seen how the messages from
our senses seem to acquire new dimensions when we bring mindfulness
to them in the present moment-how eating a raisin can become a
novel sensory, even sensual, experience or how walking reveals itself to
be a mechanical, tactile, and kinesthetic miracle. If we can come to
know sensations and feelings directly, befriending the sensory land­
scape of our own body, we will have a powerful new way to experience
and be in wiser relationship to every moment, including the moment
when we wake up, whether our experience of that moment is pleasant,
unpleasant, or neutral. In this chapter we delve more deeply into
mindfulness of body sensations, focusing in particular on the ways in
which mindfulness offers us new possibilities for knowing the body and
for avoiding the traps by which our usual habits of thinking about the
body ensnare us.

S ENSATIO N THRO U G H DIRECT EXPERIENCE
I NS TEAD OF THINKING

The machinery that sets the cycle o f unhappiness i n motion may oper­
ate so smoothly that we don't even detect its workings, but that does
not mean that it is an unstoppable j uggernaut. Every link that keeps
the machine going-body-thoughts, thoughts-feelings, feelings-body,
and so forth-is an opportunity to redirect the sequence. The cycle can
be broken simply by bringing mindful awareness to its links and, in par­
ticular, to the body. This may be hard to believe. Truthfully, the only
way to confirm it is through your own experience. If right now you're
thinking that you are already aware of your fatigue-too aware of it, in
fact-it may be helpful to recall the theme sounded in Chapters 2 and
3 , namely, that mindfulness is not j ust about paying more attention, but
rather about cultivating a different, wiser kind of attention.
As we have seen, in doing mode we see the world only indirectly,
through the veil of our thinking and labeling. If we think about our
bodies in the usual way (from the perspective of our heads ) , then as
soon as we feel listless on awaking, our mind fills with ideas about the
body, what is going on in our lives, everything. This way of paying at­
tention will j ust make things worse. If, instead, we begin to focus on
the body from the perspective of being mode, we open to a direct sens­
ing of the body itself. Moment by moment, we can become aware of
body sensations but now in a new way, a way that does not keep

us

so

stuck obsessing in our thoughts about how we are feeling in the body. This
can help our feelings of sluggishness to dissipate or dissolve, like a fog
lifting. We don't have to make them go away. Sooner or later, they will
inevitably fade on their own because we are no longer feeding them
with incessant negative thinking, without even realizing it. In the pro­
cess, we shift from feeling powerless in their presence to having viable
ways to be in relationship to them or anything else that arises.
Mindfulness involves settling into awareness itself, which is as dif­
ferent from thoughts and feelings as the sky is different from the clouds,
birds, and weather patterns that pass through it. It is a bigger container,

in which all the other
events of mind and body
unfold. It is a different
way of knowing, a differ­
ent way of being. It is a
capacity that we all al­
ready have, one that is

innate to being human. And we can learn to trust it. We can practice
resting in awareness more, in this way of knowing and being. We might
even find that this awareness itself offers a certain kind of shelter or
refuge from the stress and strain of life, freeing us from the habitual and
vicious cycles of the doing mode and the clouds of depression that
hang over us.
As we've said, doing mode and its thinking patterns tend to ob­
scure the experiential quality of being mode. For this reason, mindful­
ness training involves extensive practice in getting in touch, moment
by moment, with the direct experience of life unfolding. The body is a
great place to start cultivating this new way of being. The very physi­
cality of raw bodily sensations provides an ideal base from which to de­
velop a new, more direct, experiential, sensory way of knowing.
Somewhat amazingly, we can bring mindfulness to our experience
of the body in any moment, under any circumstances. We can even be­
gin as we sit right here, right now, through the following simple experi­
ment.
Choose a part of the body and think about it for a moment. Let's
say we focus on the hands, thinking about them without actually look­
ing at them. Usually, when we think about our hands, the picture we
have of them in our minds is as we normally see them, from the per­
spective of our eyes in our head. It's as though we are the observer up in
the head. We know where the hands are and what they look like , but
we're a bit separated from them. We may find ourselves having lots of
thoughts about our hands. We may like or dislike the shape of our
hands; we may find ourselves thinking about how our hands or finger­
nails compare with those of our friends or how they are aging. But what
if we approach our hands in a different way ?

Mindfu l Awa reness of the H a n d s
Fi rst of a l l , as best you ca n, bring you r attention right into you r ha nds,
whatever position they a re in at this moment, without looking at them .
Allow you r awa reness to fi l l you r hands from inside to outside, from the
bones rig ht out to the skin itself and the fi ngernai l s . Open in awa reness
to a ny and a l l sensations in the fingertips, in the fingers, sensing the air
between and around the fi ngers, feeling how it feels on the backs of the
hands and in the pa l ms, the th u m bs, and the wrists . Also, open to the
sense of touch wherever the hands make contact with an object, such as
with you r knees, if you r hands a re resting on them, or with the chair or
cushion. N ote the tacti le elements and the tem perature, a ny sense of
hard ness or softness, of cool ness or wa rmth-whatever is present.
N ow move you r hands to the chair on which you are sitti ng, gently
touching the side of the chair with the fingerti ps, very lig htly, maintaining
awareness of the sensations i n the fi ngers. N ow, g ripping the sides of the
chair, pay attention to the physica l sensations i n the body where you ' re
g rippi n g . Bring awa reness rig ht down i nto the fi ngers and ha nds, d irectly
sensing the contact with the chair, the pressu re in the fingers where they
a re gripping it, exploring with awa reness the actu a l contact between the
fingers and the chair. Feel the tig htness in the muscles, perhaps a sense
of coolness or ting l i ng and a flux of other sensations. And now just ease
off a nd, keeping the awa reness in the ha nds, see if there is a ny change i n
the sensations, pa using for a moment t o feel what's going on in you r
h a n d s right now.

From this little exercise, did you notice any difference between
thinking about your hands and sensing them directly ? One feature of di­
rect sensing is that the feelings coming from your hands may not be
"hand-shaped"-we may simply experience our hands as patterns of
different sensations: pressure, warmth or coldness, tingling or numb­
ness.
This distinction between thinking about the body and directly expe­
riencing the sensations in the body is critically important. Often we see
the body as if from a lofty citadel in the head. We look down on the
body (physically and metaphorically) and think "Oh, yes, there's a bit

1 02

MOMENT BY MOMENT

of a pain there, a bit of an itch there-I must do something about it."
But there is a different possibility. We can learn to bring the mind right

into the body and inhabit the whole of it with awareness.

What Can We Learn from Direct Bodily Experience?
Let's look at Nancy's experience with the preceding experiment. In the
first part of the exercise, Nancy was able to get a picture of what her
hands looked like quite easily-she had been thinking a lot lately
about how worn-out she looked, and she had noticed that her hands
were beginning to look tired and old. Thinking about her hands
brought back memories: she remembered her mother's hands, so strong
and powerful when Nancy was a child and so old and weak when,
many years later, Nancy was caring for her mother. That was twenty
years ago. Now it was Nancy's tum to have the old hands, to feel that
life was slipping by. Thinking and memory, so much a part of the doing
mode's way of knowing, had already taken Nancy quite a distance away
from the immediacy of her present experience.
In the second part of the experiment, Nancy found herself directly
tuning in to the sensations in her hands. She noticed some tingling in
her fingers, and although at first she started to wonder whether this
might mean circulation problems, she was able to come back to simply
focusing on the sensations. She noticed that the tingling had faded,
and her hands now felt warm-but the warmth came and went as she
focused her attention on the sensations. When she touched the chair,
she had a sense of the coolness of the metal and a slight numbness as
she gripped it. She became quite absorbed in noticing the way the sen­
sations from her hand did not feel hand-shaped-this was a new expe­
rience for her. At the end of the exercise, she realized that her mind
had been quite focused and that it had not wandered so much. Her
focus on directly sensing the body seemed to have temporarily weak­
ened the chatter of her mind; the direct experiential knowing of the
being mode meant that she was able to stay closer to her immediate,
bare experience and was less likely to get carried away by thought.

What was Nancy learning ? She was
discovering that there were different
ways she could pay attention and know
herself. If she thought about her body in
her usual way, her mind would be filled

with ideas and concepts and all their associations. Now she saw that she could focus on her body or any part of
it, but as patterns of directly experienced sensations. Although she did
not know it, she had shifted her mode of mind from doing to being as
this experiment unfolded.
This shift is particularly important to those of us who have strug­
gled with chronic unhappiness because for us the thoughts that are so
quick to j ump in and take over are often negative and self-critical, and
they pull us down into depression. The experience of inhabiting the
body with full awareness without succumbing to the pull of our
thoughts about the body can lead to a profoundly liberating change in
our relationship to our bodies-and to life more generally.
In time and with practice, we can extend this little experiment
with bringing mindfulness to our hands to the entire body. In the pro­
cess, we may see a marked shift in our attention, away from living so
much of our lives in our heads and toward letting our awareness take
up residence in the whole of the body. In our mindfulness training pro­
grams, we begin to nurture such a shift through a meditation practice
known as the "body scan."

THE BO DY S CAN

The body scan is a lying-down meditation practice we introduce in the
very first session of our mindfulness programs and then ask people to
practice daily for at least two weeks on their own at home, using in­
structions from an audiotape or CD. The body scan guides us in paying
attention, directly and systematically, to each part of the body in turn.
It encourages us to be in a more interested, intimate, and friendly rela­
tionship to the body in the present moment. It is sometimes challeng-

1 04

M O M E N T B Y M O M EN T

ing to bring attention to all the varied regions of the body in this way.
For that reason, we use the breath to "carry" awareness into each part
of the body, imagining, or sensing, that the breath can actually move
throughout the body, bringing with it a direct, experiential sensing and
knowing of the region of the body we are focusing on.
You might like to do this exercise yourself right now, using the in­
structions on the CD that accompanies this book (Track 2 ) . Or you
might prefer to do it a little later if you can't do it immediately.

Body Sca n Med itation
1 . Make you rself comforta ble lying down on you r back, i n a place
where you wi l l feel wa rm and und istu rbed . You can lie on a mat or rug on
the floor or on you r bed . Allow you r eyes to close gently.
2. Take a few moments to get in touch with the movement of you r
breath a n d the sensations i n you r body. When you a re ready, bring you r
awareness to the physica l sensations i n you r body, especia l ly t o the sen­
sations of touch or pressu re where you r body makes contact with the
floor or bed . On each out-breath, a l low you rself to sink a l ittle deeper i nto
the mat or bed .

3 . To set the appropriate i ntention, rem i nd you rself that this wil l be a
time for "fa l l i ng awake" rather tha n fa l l i n g asleep. Remind you rself as
wel l that the idea here is to be aware of you r experience as it is u nfolding,
however it is. It is not to change the way you a re feeling or to become
more relaxed or ca l mer. The i ntention of this practice is to bring awa re­
ness to a ny and a l l sensations you a re able to be awa re of (or lack of sen­
sation) as you focus you r attention systematica l ly on each part of the
body i n tu rn.
4 . Now bring you r awa reness to the sensations i n the bel ly, becom­

ing aware of the changing patterns of sensations in the a bdominal wa l l
as the breath moves i nto the body a n d as i t moves out o f the body. Take a
few minutes to feel the sensations as you breathe in and as you breathe
out, as the belly rises on the i n-breath and fa l l s on the out-breath .
5. Having connected with the sensations in the bel ly, now bring the
focus or spotl ight of you r attention down the left leg, i nto the left foot,
and a l l the way to the toes . Focus on each of the toes in turn, bringing a

A Different Way of Knowing

1 05

gentle, interested, affectionate attention to be with and investigate the
q u a lity of the sensations you find, perhaps noticing the sense of contact
between the toes, a sense of ti ngling, warmth, perhaps n u m b ness, what­
ever is here, perhaps even no sensations at a l l if that is the case. It is a l l
okay. I n fact, whatever you a re experiencing i s okay; i t is what is here
rig ht now.
6. When you a re ready, on an in-breath, feel or imagine the breath
enteri ng the l u ngs and then passing a l l the way down the body, through
the l eft leg, to the toes of the left foot. On the out-breath, feel or imagine
the breath coming all the way back up from the toes and the foot, right
up through the l eg and torso and out through the nose . As best you can,
continue breathing in this way for a few breaths, breathing down i nto the
toes on each in-breath and back out from the toes on each out-breath . It
may be d ifficult to g et the hang of this-just practice this "breathing i nto"
as best you can, approaching it playful ly.
7. N ow, when you a re ready, on an out-breath, let go of the toes and
bring you r awareness to the sensations in the bottom of you r left foot­
bringing a gentle, i nvestigative awareness to the sole of the foot, the in­
step, the heel (noticing, for exa mple, the sensations where the heel
makes contact with the mat or bed ) . Experiment with "breath ing with"
a ny and a l l sensations-being awa re of the breath in the backg round,
as, i n the foreg round, you explore the sensations i n the bottom of the
foot.
8. N ow a l low the awareness to expa nd i nto the rest of the foot-to
the a nkle, the top of the foot, rig ht i nto the bones and joints. Then take a
deeper and more i ntentional breath in, d i recti ng it down i nto the whole
of the left foot, and, as the breath l ets go on the out-breath, let go of the
left foot completely, a l l owing the focus of awareness to move into the
lower left l eg-the ca lf, shin, knee, and so forth, i n turn .
9. Continue to scan the body, l ingering for a time with each part of
the body in turn : the left shin, the left knee, the left thigh; the rig ht toes
and then foot and a nkle, the right lower leg, the right knee, the right
thigh; the pelvic a rea-g roin, genitals, buttocks, and h ips; the lower back
and the a bdomen, the upper back and the chest and shoulders. Then we
move to ha nds, usual ly doing both at the sa me time. We rest first with the
sensations in the fingers and thum bs, the pa lms and the backs of both
ha nds, the wrists, the lower a rms and el bows, the upper a rms; the -+

shoulders again and the a rmpits; the neck; the face (jaw, mouth, lips,
nose, cheeks, ea rs, eyes, forehead); and then the enti rety of the hea d .
1 0 . W h e n you become awa re o f tension or o f other i ntense sensa­
tions i n a pa rticu lar part of the body, you ca n "breathe i n" to those sensa­
tions in the same way as you ca n to a ny others-using the in-breath to
gently bring awareness rig ht into the sensations, a nd, as best you can,
have a sense of what happens i n that reg ion, if a nything, as each breath
lets go and releases on the out-breath .
1 1 . The mind wi l l inevita bly wa nder away from the breath and the
body from time to time. That is entirely norma l . It is what m i nds do.
When you notice it, gently acknowledge it, noticing where the mind has
gone off to, and then gently return you r attention to the part of the body
you intended to focus on.
1 2 . After you have sca n ned the whole body i n this way, spend a few
m i n utes being aware of a sense of the body as a whole and of the breath
flowing freely in and out of the body.
1 3 . It is a lso very i mportant to remind you rself that if you, l ike most
modern people, suffer from low-g rade chronic sleep deprivation, si nce
the body sca n is done lyi ng down, it is very easy to fa l l asleep. If you find
you rself fa l l i ng asleep, you might fi nd it helpfu l to prop you r head up with
a pillow, open you r eyes, or do the practice sitti ng up rather tha n lyi ng
down .

A Relaxing Meditation?
As we see from the instructions for the body scan, the point of this
practice is to be aware of your body as it is. It is not to achieve a state of
relaxation. And yet deep states of relaxation often emerge, so much so
that people sometimes find themselves falling asleep. Of course, if this
happens, we often blame ourselves for not staying awake and com­
pound our distress with a self-critical attitude. Alternatively we can see
if it makes a difference to practice with eyes open or sitting up rather
than lying down or to practice at a different time of day. We can also
take a kindly attitude toward any feelings of sleepiness that do occur.
And we can investigate what sleepiness feels like from the inside. In all

A Different Way of Knowing

107

these various ways, we gradually learn how to "fall awake" and stay
awake while practicing meditation lying down, no matter how relaxed
we do or don't get.
Jan found that she got so relaxed with the body scan that the sen­
sations from the body gave her the impression of floating:
"At the end, I was so relaxed, it was as if my limbs and trunk were­
n't actually real. I know it might sound really strange, but it was won­
derful, as if I was floating. It's very hard to describe. I think my breath­
ing was a lot slower; I should think my heart was a lot slower. I j ust felt
my whole body had sort of slowed down completely."
J an also said it came as a great relief to enter a level of the mind that
was not dominated by thinking. She said she was able to let go of all the
mental clutter during the body scan and found it profoundly calming.
Why might we find it relaxing even though we are not purposely
trying to relax ? The body scan, like the breathing meditation described
in Chapter 4, invites us to focus on relatively narrow aspects of our to­
tal experience in any given moment. Furthermore, it asks us to system­
atically shift from one locus of attention in the body to another over a
fairly extended period of time. We might expect that the mind would
become steadier through such a discipline over time and that we might
feel more relaxed as a result. As long as Jan was "living in her head,"
and knowing her experience only indirectly, through thought, it was
very difficult for her to focus her attention wholeheartedly. Thoughts
themselves are ephemeral and fleeting, hardly present for a moment
before they trigger associations and memories that carry us far from
where we were only a moment ago. They do not provide the stability of
focus the mind needs if it is to be steady and calm. By contrast, when
we cultivate mindfulness, by paying attention to the detailed pattern of
sensations in a particular part of the body in any and every moment, we
have a vivid and accessible obj ect to anchor our attention in each mo­
ment, even if its location is shifting over time as we move through the
body. Just being able to focus on one thing at a time in this way allowed
the rest of Jan's mind to settle, and she experienced a sense of calm,
even though she was not looking for it.

1 08

M O M E N T B Y M O M EN T

Similarly, the non-striving quality of mindfulness introduced in
Chapter 4 fosters the development of peace and calm. There is no
agenda other than to be awake, nowhere to get to, no special state to
look out for or to try to attain. No matter what sensations we en­
counter when we practice the body scan-and that might include
numbness or no sensation, or, for that matter, unpleasant or even
painful sensations in certain regions-we allow them all to be j ust as
they are, rather than trying to change them in any way. We are not
trying to close the gap between the way things are and the way
the doing mind would like them to be. Instead, we are resting in
our moment-by-moment experiencing of what is already here to be
perceived, to be known directly, not through the intermediary of
thought. You could say we are resting in the domain of being, in
awareness itself. It's not hard to imagine that such an orientation to­
ward our experience might be calming.
That said, it can be unhelpful for people to see the body scan as a
form of relaxation training for the simple reason that it encourages old
habits of mind to start up again. As with the breathing meditation in
Chapter 4, we can inadvertently tum discovery into expectation and
end up making relaxation the purpose and goal of the body scan: "This
calm is what it's all about; this means I'm getting somewhere." This is
precisely what Jan experienced. She had felt very relaxed, floating,
wonderful. "But then, I think it was two days later, I could feel myself
drifting off like that again. I remember thinking Ah, here it is again. This

is wonderful. And as soon as I thought this, I could feel myself losing it,
and I thought, Oh , I want to be like that again . And then I was really dis­
appointed. The last two or three times that I 've listened to the CD, I
found myself thinking beforehand, Oh great, I hope I'm going to feel like

that again . And it hasn't happened."
Jan wanted to experience relaxation so badly that it escaped her,
like a handful of dry sand grasped so tightly that it runs through the
fingers. So what can we or Jan do at this point ?
If we find the body scan peaceful and calming, we can simply be
aware of these feelings experientially. To experience feelings is to know
that they come and they go; they arise and they pass away. The point is

A Different Way of Knowing

1 09

to be here for them, to be directly aware of them as they are, whether
pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral and barely noticeable.
Gradually, people discover for themselves the power of working in
this way with whatever is arising in the body scan. It is the basis of a
profound insight: when we stop trying to attain pleasant feelings, such
feelings are more likely to emerge by themselves. With this insight may
come another profound lesson: we already have the capacity to experi­
ence peace and happiness deep within ourselves. As we have said, we
do not have to earn enough points to deserve it or hunt for it some­
place else. We simply have to learn how to skillfully get out of our own
way. Getting out of our own way allows the deep reservoirs of peace
and happiness within us to reveal themselves so we may gain more
ready access to them. For those of us who have been "fighting" unhap­
piness for much of our lives, this can be an enormously liberating
change.

When we stop trying to force pleasant feel ings,
they a re freer to emerge on their own .
When we stop trying to resist u npleasant feeli ngs,
we may find that they can d rift away by themselves .
When we stop tryi ng to make something happen,
a whole world of fresh a nd u na nticipated
experiences may become accessible to us.

The invitation with the body scan and with all mindfulness prac­
tices is to let go of our expectations as best as we possibly can. Expecta­
tions can become goals, which only get in the way of the experience we
are having in this moment. But when we recognize that we are devel­
oping expectations, as J an did, we can see how vulnerable we are to
turning aspects of our experience into fixed goals-an important lesson
in and of itself. It helps us learn to recognize when we are shifting into
doing mode. By cultivating mindfulness in the body scan on a regular
basis, J an was beginning to recognize this pattern and found herself
smiling at its antics.

110

MOMENT BY MOMENT

Mind Wandering:
Another Opportunity to Recognize Doing Mode
One of the most useful functions of the mind is to keep bringing up un­
finished business so that goals that are important to us will not fall by
the wayside. This little tickler system can keep us from missing a criti­
cal deadline or ensure that we patch up a damaged friendship that's im­
portant to us. But this function has a tendency to volunteer for duty
when we don't need it, as Lauren found during her practice of the body
scan.
Quite a lot had been happening in Lauren's family. Her elderly
father- in-law, Phil, had recently fallen and broken his hip, and it had
taken a lot of effort to figure out a way to get good care for him, given
that all of his children and their partners worked full time. Lauren was
focusing on sensations in her hip when she found her mind wandering.
"First I was sensing my hip," she said, "then I noticed myself
thinking about its shape and remembering a picture of the hip in my
biology textbook. Then I remembered Phil's broken hip-and I started
to think about him in the hospital."
We can notice how the first step in the wanderings of Lauren's
mind was relatively subtle; she made a shift from focusing on the direct
sensation of the hip to thinking about the hip-from knowing through
experience to knowing through ideas.
And once Pandora's box was opened, all the associations, memo­
ries, and other clutter of the doing mind rushed to the surface to take
Lauren further and further from her intended focus: first to an associa­
tion from her past, then to her father-in-law, and from there to the im­
age of him lying in his hospital bed. Her mind's meanderings did not
end there:
"That made me think about Bill's [her husband's] sister. She said
she'd take time off to look after him, but she hasn't. Then I was re­
membering a difficult phone call in which another member of the fam­
ily said that she j ust couldn't cope with the parents anymore."
Once she had strayed from her intended focus on physical sensa­
tions in the body, Lauren's attention shifted to the unfinished business

A Different Way of Knowing

111

of caregiving and families. At some stage (she wasn't sure when) she
nodded off to sleep for a few minutes.
At first Lauren was angry when her mind continued to wander. But,
after practicing the body scan for about two weeks, she noticed that
something was changing in her. "Before, " she said, "I would get into a
tizzy and start throwing mental pots and pans about the place-j ust in
my mind, you understand. I'd think and think: Well, no one cares ; I'm

the only one that knows what to do about Phil and how to look after him , and
if Gail can't do it, then she can stay away for all I care . Well, the pots
and pans I was throwing in my mind only hurt me, because no one
else saw them being thrown. Now I can feel the stress in my body, but
I'm neither running away from it nor getting upset about being upset."
Lauren found that, when her mind wandered off, it was more ef­
fective and appropriate to simply smile to herself in recognition of it
and j ust gently bring it back to where she had intended it to be rather
than to berate herself. Furthermore, she said that coming back to the
level of sensations allowed her to be in touch with and "feel" the stress
of her life but without overreacting.

No Such Thing as a Bad Meditation
Whether we've come to expect the relaxation or calm that may ac­
company the body scan or we tend to scold ourselves for letting our
minds wander, it's easy to attach goals to meditation and start to think
of a particular session as "good" or "bad" or as "working" or "not work­
ing." Because of the aversion we feel for unpleasant emotion, we may
also be tempted, if we felt impatient throughout, restless, uncomfort­
able, itchy or irritable, cold or hot, or in pain, to say we had a "bad"
meditation. We may never want to do the body scan again, because,
obviously, the meditation didn't "work." Something was wrong: maybe
we blame the CD or the teacher or the method, or we think of our­
selves as failures. And if we also imagine that meanwhile other people
are having wonderful experiences with the body scan, we will j ust have
one more reason to think we're failing.

There is no such thing as failing at meditation , as long as we are mindful of

1 12

MOMENT BY MOMENT

our experience , whatever it is . In fact, this is precisely why the body scan is
so powerful. It gives us opportunity after opportunity to rest in or return
to the being mode, with its direct experiential knowing, even in the pres­
ence of strong emotion, thoughts, or sensations. Like all the other medi­
tation practices, the body scan becomes a laboratory for our own learning
and growing-learning not to get stuck in self-perpetuating cycles of pre­
occupation and unhappiness, growing into a greater intimacy and com­
fort with ourselves. The things that come up from moment to moment in
the body scan all become our teachers to further this learning and this
growing, whether they appear as pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral.
The body scan is

aimed at freeing us from
the suffering and men­
tal anguish that arises
through wanting things

from

the way they are in this moment. In the body scan, as in life itself, we
are in a much stronger, freer position if we can let go of the desire to
feel calm-or enlightened or at peace or filled with j oy-and instead
can learn to be present with whatever we are feeling right now.
This might mean recognizing tension or restlessness in certain re­
gions of the body and letting them be as they are, instead of starting a
mental harangue about why we're feeling such stress.
It might mean noticing an overall sense of tiredness but not wear­
ing ourselves out with exhortations to perk up and get going.
It might mean feeling a glimmering of peace or j oy under layers of
moodiness, tension, or irritation and j ust knowing it's there, rather
than digging frantically to drag it to the surface and demand that it
dominate how we feel right this minute.

MINDFUL AWAKENING IN THE MORNING
Let's return to where we began: feeling an unpleasant heaviness and fa­
tigue on waking in the morning. For many of us, dealing with this feel-

A lot of i mporta nce i s attached to the body sca n in our mindfu l ness train­

prog rams spend forty-five minutes a day on this practice, six days a week,
for at least the first two weeks, even when, as often happens, they may
not feel much i m mediate benefit. If you fi nd you rself struggling with
keeping up the practice, you might l ike to fol low the advice we g ive to
those attending our training progra m s : just do it as best you can and stay
in the process whether you think it is "working" or not. The practice itself
winds up revea ling new possibil ities if you just stay with it. Why?
•

Because the body sca n provides a wonderfu l a rena to cu ltivate a
new, experientia l way of knowing.

•

Because the body sca n offers us the opportu nity to reconnect with
our bodies, which play a key role in the experience and expression
of emotion.

•

Because mi ndfu l awareness of sensations in our bodies can uncou­
ple the l i nks between body sensations and thinking that keep the

to other aspects of our l ives.

On the horizon, then, is the possibil ity of freeing ou rselves from some
of our most l i m iti ng self-i mposed constrai nts on happiness and wel l ­
being.

ing can be quite difficult. Of course we would rather not experience
such feelings. But here is where the practice of the body scan may be of
real use. If we have practiced the body scan for even a few days, we will
have begun relating to the body as it is and not as we may wish it were.
In the body scan, we discover the possibility of approaching things
from a fresh perspective, and this becomes applicable at all times, even
when we don't have time to do an extended body scan.

1 14

MOMENT BY MOMENT

So, on waking, how might we approach the situation differently ?
We will be able to recognize the early warning signs of what might be­
come a vicious cycle and begin to practice inhabiting the being mode
of mind. We will focus our attention directly on our body sensations
and rest in the awareness of them as they are. This allows us to be with
the uncomfortable sensations without trying to avoid them or making
them worse through thinking about them. Even in the very earliest
stages of the body scan practice, this alternative to doing mind can
have an impact on something as common and mundane as early morn­
ing weariness. That sense of heaviness is greatly increased by negative
thoughts. But mindfulness in the same situation-bringing a gentle
and compassionate awareness to the bodily sensations themselves,
without trying to change them, and letting go of thoughts about them
or about ourselves, or about anything-can be immensely energizing.
Once we have some experience with the body scan, we can bring
this kind of awareness to bear in a matter of moments. We can even
scan the body for one in-breath and one out-breath or j ust breathe
with the body as a whole for five minutes or so, or even a minute or
two, before getting out of bed.
It might j ust change our whole day.

truck in front of him backed up, hitting the front of his car. It didn't do
much damage, but enough for John to know that he'd have to call the
insurance company. Even worse, the truck driver had denied he was
backing up. He said that John had j ust driven into him from behind.
John drove home in a quiet fury. He was tense, his face was red, his
blood pressure was up, he was frowning. When he arrived home, he
slumped into a chair and decided not to worry about the car until to­
morrow. That made him feel better. He picked up the mail. The first
letter was from his bank, asking if he would call to discuss something
concerning his pension payments. John rose from the chair, thumped
on the table, and stormed out of the house.
Only later, once he and his wife had talked about it, was it clear to
John that his tension over the car had spilled into his reaction to the
(otherwise innocuous ) letter. John's wife and family said they had been
able to tell he was tense j ust by looking at him. His whole body had
seemed tight, and his posture was that of someone who was fed up.
John himself had no idea that he was still feeling so bad. He looked sur­
prised when his wife asked him if he was feeling better and denied hav117

118

TRAN SFORM ING UNHAPPINESS

ing any lingering feelings about the accident or the letter. H e simply
brushed off both as passing annoyances, saying he was fine, with a tight
smile that looked more like a grimace to his wife.
John was completely out of touch with the signals his body was
sending him-not j ust on this one occasion but as a rule. As a result,
he didn't really notice all of his emotional reactions-at least not be­
fore they had pulled his mood downward. By then it was too late to
take timely action to deal with them. Not only that, but John's overre­
action to the bank's letter was a direct result of the tension that was
lingering following his encounter with the truck driver. His lack of
awareness meant that the state of his mind was controlled by his body
and emotions to an extent that would have alarmed him. As we saw in
Chapters 2 and 5, the state of our bodies supplies important informa­
tion to the mind, and, if we are unaware of it, this can powerfully affect
our j udgments, thoughts, and feelings. Frowning, for instance, makes us
j udge our experiences more negatively. By the same token, John's tight
body and grimacing expression kindled a frustration that fed into his
reaction to the bank's letter.
His unawareness of the full range of his emotional and physical re­
sponses was a direct result of his efforts to avoid feelings he didn't want.

WHY WE TUNE O UT

As we discussed in Chapter 2, it is understandable that we make an en­
emy of our emotions if we've experienced painful moods and feelings in
the past. We react to our own unhappiness as if it were a threat, and
when we do so, the brain's avoidance system is triggered. Not only do
we damp down approach-related behaviors, such as curiosity, engage­
ment, and goodwill, but the mind is also driven to avoid even its own
productions by walling them off, suppressing them, numbing out, or, in
one way or another, pretending that they are not around even when
they are. The effect is not only to disconnect us from negative or un­
comfortable feelings and body sensations, but possibly to mute our abil­
ity to feel anything, positive or negative. We handicap ourselves in

Reconnecting with Our Feelings

1 19

dealing effectively with unhappiness and reinforce the sense that,
somehow, we are out of touch with the full experience of being alive
but don't know exactly why.
This attempt to avoid our own emotions, our thoughts, our feel­
ings, and our body sensations is called experiential avoidance. Not sur­
prisingly, it can become a habit. Who wouldn't tune out feelings and
body sensations if the news on this frequency had been too unpleasant
too often ? But pretending some feeling isn't actually here is like hear­
ing a strange noise from your car engine while driving along the free­
way and dealing with it by turning up the volume on the car radio. It
works pretty well to blank out the noise, but is not too effective in pre­
venting the engine from seizing up ten miles down the road. Psycholo­
gist Steve Hayes and his colleagues concluded from a review of more
than one hundred research studies that many forms of emotional dis­
turbance are the result of unhealthy efforts to escape and avoid
emotions-that is, the result of experiential avoidance. If we try to
wall off bodily sensations, thoughts, and feelings that are part-and­
parcel of our emotional experience, then psychologically our mental
"engines" are highly likely to seize up as well !
In the long run, experiential avoidance simply does not work as a
way to deal with unwanted and unpleasant feelings. Although we
might not be aware of them, the unpleasant feelings are still with us,
and they still trigger habitual reactions that can turn passing feelings of
unpleasantness into persistent suffering. Unless we are aware of them,
unpleasant feelings will directly and indirectly influence our attitudes
and j udgments in ways that only perpetuate our unhappiness. Unless we

are aware . There's the problem. When "tuning out" has become a
habit, how can we learn to "tune back in" without becoming over­
whelmed ? It is helpful to know that an aspect of our inner experience
can help. We call it the "internal barometer."

The Internal Barometer
When looking for a new place to live, we often spend many hours visit­
ing potential homes. Have you ever come upon a house or an apart-

1 20

TRAN SFORM I N G UNHAPPINESS

ment that sounded perfect-it has the number of rooms you need,
more than adequate square footage, excellent amenities, and a great
neighborhood-until you visit it? As soon as you walk through the
door, you know it is not the place for you. You may not be able to say
why. It is j ust an intuition. It is conscious-you are very aware of it­
yet it's not expressible in words. It is j ust, somehow, a readout of your
directly sensed gut-level evaluation of the situation. It may even be so
strong that you feel you j ust want to get out as quickly as possible.
Our feelings may have many dimensions, but underneath and un­
derpinning them all is a single scale in the mind that simply registers
experience as "positive," "neutral," or "negative." It is as if this capacity
functions as an internal barometer. Just as a real barometer provides a
continuous readout of atmospheric pressure, this internal barometer
provides a readout of the "internal atmosphere" of our experience in
each moment. But j ust as we need to read the barometer to gain infor­
mation about the weather, we will need to read ( and, if necessary, learn
how to read ) this internal barometer by becoming more aware of what
we are really feeling from moment to moment. In this way we have the
possibility to act more appropriately and with greater balance of mind,
particularly in very trying situations.
We do this by learning to attend more closely to the chain of our
reactions to any object, person, place, or event we encounter. If we do
so, we'll discover that there is an instinctive sense of the experience as
pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral. If an experience registers as pleasant,
the chain of reactions will tend to go in one direction, at the end of
which we may become aware of wanting to prolong the experience. If
an experience registers as unpleasant, the chain of reactions will cas­
cade in another direction, at the end of which we may become aware of
wanting it to go away or to escape from it. Often most of this is com­
pletely automatic and goes on beneath the surface of awareness.
If we actually practice bringing awareness to the chain of reactions
to particular moments and circumstances, we have an excellent oppor­
tunity, each time we do so, to break the strong link between these basic
"gut feelings" and the totally automatic and also largely unconscious
reactions that follow so rapidly on their heels, and in particular the re-

Each of us has an internal monitor of

a generic "early warning
system" for all afflictive emotions, whatever form they take as they
emerge into consciousness. By tuning in with great sensitivity to the
messages of the internal barometer, we may recognize any unpleasant
feelings that we have previously screened out, as they are actually aris­

ing. Bringing them into awareness weakens their influence over our
mind and enables us to respond to them in ways that do not evoke or
perpetuate aversion and make spiraling into depression more likely.
What is the most reliable way to tune in to this early warning sys­
tem ? We hinted at it in Chapter 5. By bringing awareness to the body
in a certain way, we can discover and make wise use of our own inter­
nal barometer.

O PENING UP NEW POSS IB ILITIES

To accomplish this, we need an effective way to tune in to body sensa­
tions and feelings so we know, directly and immediately, our intuitive
evaluation of any moment. That will give us a chance to respond to a
particular situation in ways that are more effective than our habitual,
automatic emotional reactions.
For example, if a fleeting memory makes us feel suddenly sad or
unhappy, we may not need to know what aspect of the memory trig­
gered the emotion. The memory itself, or the emotion it evokes, will be
registered as "unpleasant," and it is this gut sense of unpleasantness
that fuels the chain reaction that ensues. This might once have been
the start of a downward spiral, but it doesn't have to be. For we can

transform a cascade of reactions into a series of choice points.

1 22

TRAN SFORM ING UNHAPPINESS

The moment in which we notice aversion emerging in response to
our identifying some event { such as a sad feeling} as unpleasant be­
comes a defining moment, a critical point at which mindfulness can
open up new possibilities. For one thing, by bringing a friendly non­
j udgmental awareness right in close to the body sensations that accom­
pany the unhappiness, we can immediately make wiser use of the infor­
mation implicit in the sensations and feelings themselves. Eventually
we will discover ways of responding mindfully to the unhappiness itself,
as it is felt in the body. This enormously increases the likelihood that it
will either dissolve on the spot or dissipate more gradually in its own
good time.
We may now begin to see how opening our awareness to our di­
rectly sensed experience of the body can reconnect us with emotions
that we may have been avoiding. For many of us, it may be difficult at
first to differentiate between that first perception of an "unpleasant"
quality within the experience and the downstream reaction of aver­
sion, because they are likely to be experienced as a fused whole. That is
not necessarily a problem because we can always j ust take it one step at
a time. First, we may be able to be aware of the whole "fused" ensemble
as a feeling of overall contraction somewhere in the body that itself
feels somewhat unpleasant. Second, having recognized the contraction
at the level of sensation and become a little more familiar with it, we
can begin to recognize the unpleasant feeling/aversion ensemble more
and more clearly. This is a great step forward. Then, by practicing med­
itations that are specifically focused on refining our awareness of the
body {such as the body scan and the practices described in this chap­
ter } , it can become easier to detect the unpleasant quality in the feel­
ing before it triggers aversion. Finally, and little by little, we may begin
to notice that they are distinct-the unpleasantness registered first,
followed by the "get me out of here" reaction of aversion, which is also
then registered as unpleasant, and so the cycle continues.
It is helpful to know that the most easily recognized expressions of
aversion in the body are feelings of contraction in the shoulders or
lower back, a tightening of the forehead, a clenching of the j aw, and a
tightening of the belly. We have these fight-or-flight reactions whether

Reconnecting with Our Feelings

1 23

we're trying to escape from a tiger or from our own feelings. Like John,
however, we often stop noticing these aversive physiological reactions
when the tiger is inside of us and has been with us for quite some time
with no evident plans to vacate the premises.
So, taking it one step at a time, how can we become more aware of
the "ensemble" we have described, the body sensations that will reveal
the fusion of the initial barometer reading "unpleasant" and the cas­
cade of habitual reactions that follow it? We have already started, for
there is an infinite number of opportunities each time we practice the
body scan (Chapter 5 ) . Can we be aware of feelings of unpleasantness
or pleasantness and their immediate manifestation as sensations in the
body moment by moment ? As we continue in that practice, we natu­
rally become more familiar with the feelings expressed not only in par­
ticular regions of the body, but also in a sense of the body as a whole,
held in awareness, as we do at the end of each body scan.
The exercises in this chapter will help us expand and deepen our
capacity to discern the whole domain of our intuitive evaluations of
experience as pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral, and how these express
themselves in the body. This will involve, among other things, deepen­
ing our familiarity and comfort level with our awareness of the body as
a unified whole and how it can help us read that vital internal barome­
ter so we know which way the interior winds are blowing. But first we
must explore some questions concerning the quality of our awareness
and our underlying motivations and how significant these might be in
the practices described in this chapter and, for that matter, in all of the
mindfulness practices we are developing.

THE MO US E IN THE MAZE

Do you remember the puzzle books that we got when we were children?
There might be connect-the-dots puzzles and find-the-differences puz­
zles. No doubt whoever was looking after us at the time hoped it would
take many quiet hours for us to j oin the dots or find the differences be­
tween two almost identical pictures. Sometimes, there'd be a maze-a

1 24

TRAN SFORM ING UNHAPPINESS

labyrinth-and our task would be to draw a way out without taking the
pencil off the page.
Some years ago, psychologists used a similar maze puzzle in an in­
triguing experiment with college students. A cartoon mouse was shown
trapped inside a picture of a maze, and the task was to help the mouse
find the way out. There were two different versions of the task. One
was positive, approach-oriented; the other was negative or avoidance­
oriented. In the positive condition, there was a piece of Swiss cheese
lying outside the maze, in front of a mouse hole. In the negative condi­
tion, the maze was exactly the same, but instead of the Swiss cheese
feast at the finish, an owl hovered above the maze, ready to swoop
down and capture the mouse in its talons at any moment.
The maze takes less than two minutes to complete, and all the stu­
dents who took part in the experiment solved their maze. But the con­
trast in the aftereffects of working on different versions of the maze was
striking. When the participants later took a test of creativity, those
who had helped their mouse avoid the owl turned in scores that were
fifty percent lower than the scores of students who had helped their
mouse find the cheese. The state of mind elicited by attending to the
owl had resulted in a lingering sense of caution, avoidance, and vigi­
lance for things going wrong. This mind-state in tum weakened cre­
ativity, closed down options, and reduced the students' flexibility in re­
sponding to the next task.
This experiment tells us something very important: the same ac­
tion ( even something as slight as solving a simple maze puzzle) has dif­
ferent consequences depending on whether it is done to move toward
something we welcome ( activating the brain's approach system) or to
avoid something negative ( activating the brain's avoidance system) . In
the maze experiment, aversion was triggered by something as minor as
the sight of a cartoon owl. It led to reductions in exploratory, creative
behaviors. This is dramatic evidence that the avoidance system can
narrow the focus of our lives, even when triggered by a purely symbolic
threat. Moreover, this experiment points to the critical importance of
the kind of motivation that we bring to the cultivation of mindfulness
in our practice. If we can infuse our attention to our bodily experience

Reconnecting with Our Feelings

1 25

with the approach qualities of interest, curiosity, warmth, and goodwill,
then not only will we be in greater touch with sensations and feelings
in each moment, we also will be directly countering any effects of aver­
sion and avoidance that may be present. As with so much of what we are
learning to do, cultivating whole­
some and kind intention and motiva­
tion is j ust as much a part of medita­
tion practice as learning how to focus

our attention in particular ways.

M INDFUL YO GA *

In the practice that follows, which builds on the work of refining
bodily awareness that we started in the body scan, we bring our atten­
tion to the range of sensations and feelings that arise in our bodies as
we go through a ten-minute sequence of gentle standing yoga stretches.
You might like to do this practice now, or as soon as you can, following
the instructions on the CD (Track 3 ; see also the next two pages ) .
I n the full mindfulness-based cognitive therapy program, this in­
troductory exposure is followed by a sitting meditation and alternated
day by day with a more extended sequence of mindful movements,
stretches, and postures based on hatha yoga practiced as a form of med­
itation in its own right. Because, to begin with, it is not easy to remem­
ber this sequence, we guide ourselves through one position after an­
other, using detailed instructions from a CD or an audiotape. (The full

TRAN SFORMING UNHAPPINESS

Mindful Sta n d ing Yoga
1 . Fi rst, w e sta nd i n ba re feet or socks with our feet a bout hips-width
apa rt, with the knees u n locked so that the legs can bend slightly and with
the feet para l lel (it's actu a l ly unusual to sta nd with the feet l ike this, and
this, itself, can generate some novel bodily sensations) .
2. N ext we remind ourselves of the i ntention of this practice : to be­
come awa re, as best we can, of physica l sensations and feel ings through­
out the body as we engage in a series of gentle stretches, honoring and
investigati ng the l i m itations of our body i n every moment, as best we can
l etting go of any tendency to push beyond our l i m its or to compete with
either ourselves or others.

3 . Then, on an in-breath, we slowly and mi ndfu l ly raise our a rms out
to the sides, para l lel to the floor, and then, after b reathing out, we con­
tinue on the next in-breath raising them, slowly and mi ndfu l ly, u ntil our
hands meet a bove our heads, all the while perhaps feel i ng the tension in
the muscles as they work to l ift the arms and then mainta in them in the
stretch .
4 . Then, letting the breath move i n and out freely a t its own pace,

we continue to stretch upwa rd, the fingertips gently pushing toward the
sky, the feet firmly g rou nded on the floor, as we feel the stretch i n the
m uscles and joints of the body a l l the way from the feet and legs up
throug h the back, shoulders, into the a rms, ha nds, and fi ngers.
5. We mainta in that stretch for a time, breathing freely in and out,
noticing a ny changes in the sensations and feel i ngs in the body with the
b reath as we continue to hold the stretch . Of cou rse, this might include a
sense of i ncreasing tension or discomfort, and if so, opening to that as
wel l .
6 . At a certa in point, when we a re ready, we slowly, very slowly, on
a n out-breath, a l l ow the a rms to come back down. We lower them slowly,
with the wrists bent so that the fi ngers point upwa rd and the pa l m s a re
pushing outward (again, a n u n usua l position) u ntil the a rms come back
to rest a longside the body, hanging from the shoulders.
7 . We then a l low the eyes to close gently and focus attention on the
movements of the breath and the sensations and fee l ings th roughout the

body a s we sta nd here, perhaps noticing the contrast i n the physica l
sense of release (and often relief) associated with returning to a neutra l
sta nce.
8 . We continue now by m indfu l ly stretching each arm and hand up
in turn, as if we were picking fru it from a tree when it was just out of
reach, with fu l l awa reness of the sensations throughout the body, and of
the breath; see what happens to the extension of the hand and to the
breath if you l ift the opposite heel off the floor while stretching up.
9 . After this sequence, now slowly and mi ndfu l ly raise both arms up
high, keeping them para l lel to each other; and then a l low the body to
bend to the left, with the hips going over to the rig ht, forming a big cres­
cent that extends i n a sideways cu rve from the feet right through the
torso, the a rms, the hands, and the fingers. Then come back to standing
on a n in-breath, and then on a n out-breath, slowing bending over, form­
ing a cu rve i n the opposite d i rection.
1 0. Once you have returned to standing i n a neutra l position with
the a rms a longside the body, you can play with rol l i ng the shoulders while
letting the arms dangle passively, first raising the shoulders upwa rd to­
wa rd the ea rs as far as they wi l l go, then backwa rd as if you were at­
tempti ng to d raw the shoulder blades together, then letting them d rop
down completely, then squeezi ng the shoulders together in front of the
body as fa r as they wil l go, as if you were trying to touch them together
with the a rms passive and d a n g l i ng, Continue "rol ling" through these
va rious positions as smooth ly and m i ndfu lly as you can, with the arms
dangling all the while, first i n one d i rection, and then i n the opposite di­
rection, i n a forward and backwa rd "rowing" motion.
1 1 . Then, once you have rested in a neutra l sta nding postu re again,
play with slowly a nd m i ndfu l ly rol l ing the head a round to whatever de­
g ree you feel comforta ble with it, a nd very gently, as if d rawing a circle
with the nose i n midair, a l l owing the circling to move gently in one d i rec­
tion and then the other.
1 2. And final ly, at the end of this sequence of movements, we re­
main sti l l for a while, in a sta nding or sitting postu re, and tune in to the
sensations from the body.

TRAN SFORM ING UNHAPPINESS

we investigated eating the raisin, bringing an openhearted awareness
to whatever is available to be experienced from moment to moment.
For this to happen, we will need to be aware of the habits we might
harbor of avoiding certain kinds of experiences altogether, especially if
they have an unpleasant quality to them. Unpleasant sensations will
certainly arise at times and in various places in the body, especially
while doing mindful yoga. These now become perfect opportunities for
exploring how unpleasantness is related to aversion. So the challenge
of each moment in the standing yoga is to purposefully experience the
body j ust as it is moment by moment, with openness and interest, as if
for the first time, and that includes sensing and gently exploring its
limits in any given stretch or posture.
For instance, we can begin by recognizing the various sensations
in the body for what they are,

as

sensations that arise and pass away. To

do this, we will need to break through the screen of any fear-laden
thoughts or expectations that might be present. Let's say we deliber­
ately hold a stretch or a posture a little longer than feels comfortable
and begin to experience some discomfort in the shoulders or back. The
challenge is to put out the welcome mat for these sensations as we hold
them in awareness and recognize their unpleasant quality. Can we no­
tice the impulse to instantly label the sensations as "pain" or the whole
experience as pure "torture" ?
By turning toward discomfort and unpleasantness and by inten­
tionally embracing them in awareness when they do arise, we are ex­
panding the heart qualities of openness and goodwill in ourselves. By
cultivating awareness in this way, we are weakening our tendency to
avoid internal experiences we don't like. At the same time, we are also
weakening our unconscious reliance on the doing mode, which, when
fear-based, only entangles us in persistent unhappiness. Some people

ing "What is this ?" as they attend to

to bring a spirit of gentleness, kindness, and compassion to ourselves,
rather than pushing beyond our limits or being critical and j udgmental
of our "performance."

Responding to the Yoga
People respond differently to the practices we are describing, but many
people find these yoga stretches enormously helpful. For anyone who
has a hard time with maintaining physical stillness over extended time
periods, such as in the body scan, the mindful yoga can often be espe­
cially effective. These postures, movements, and stretches readily
ground us in the here and now, allowing us to feel fully present with
our bodies and more awake to our wider experience of the moment.
Moving and stretching, like walking, often provide "louder" body
sensations than either the meditation on the breath or the body scan
meditation. As such, they can sometimes provide an easier focus on
which to gather our attention and open to our experience. Further­
more, the stretching of muscles that may be habitually tensed in a
chronic state of aversion can free us from emotions we may not know
we are even harboring and in which we have nevertheless gotten stuck.
As with all the other practices, the awareness we cultivate in the
mindful yoga is available to us in all our moments. Using the body to
ground us in awareness during the course of the day can be as simple as
becoming mindful of our posture or of any movement, large or small.
This doesn't actually take any more time than being out of touch with
our body and moving automatically and without awareness. Say we are
reaching for something. We are doing it anyway. There's nothing extra
we have to do. We simply bring attention to the body sensations in the
region that is moving and the regions that are not moving. We can
train ourselves to be here, right now, inhabiting the body with full
awareness. Whatever is going on in our mind or body, our internal ba­
rometer is always here for us, if we choose to read it. Doing so gives us
far greater choice in terms of what happens in the very next moment.
This in itself adds a new degree of freedom to our relationship to our
interior experience.

WIDENING ATTENTIO N ARO UND THE B REATH

In addition to using the practice of mindful yoga to ground us in the
body, we can deepen our awareness in other ways that can help us tune
in to the signals of our internal barometer. One very powerful one is to
extend the practice of mindfulness of the breath that we explored in
Chapter 4 to include a sense of the body as a whole. You might like to
experiment with this practice before reading further, following the in­
structions on the CD (Track 5 ) . As with all the practices we are explor­
ing, remember to bring the same quality of openheartedness to each
moment as best you can, directly sensing body sensations and feelings
as

sensations and feelings.

Sitting Med itation :
Mindfu lness of the B reath a n d Body
1 . Practice mi ndfu l ness of the breath, as described earlier (p. 78), for
ten m i nutes in an erect and dignified sitting posture, whether in a chair or
on the floor.
2. When you feel you have settled to some degree into feeling the
breath movi ng i n and out of you r body at the belly or at the nostri ls, i nten­
tiona l ly a l l ow the field of awareness to expa nd a round the breath to include
as wel l a sense of the va rious sensations throughout the body, whatever
they a re, and a sense of the body as a whole sitting and breath i ng . You may
even find you get a sense of the breath moving throughout the body.

3. If you choose, include together with this wider sense of the body
as a whole, and of the breath moving in and out of the body, awa reness
of the more loca l, pa rticu lar patterns of physica l sensations that a rise
where the body makes contact with the floor; chair, cushion, or stool-the
sensations of touch, pressure, or contact of the feet or knees with the
floor; the buttocks with whatever is su pporti ng them, the hands where
they rest on the thig hs or together in the lap. As best you can, hold a l l
these sensations, together with the sense of the breath a nd of the body
as a whole, in a wide and spacious awa reness .
4. Of cou rse, in a l l l i kelihood, you wi l l find the mind wa ndering re­

peatedly away from the breath and body sensations. Keep in mind that

this is a natura l tendency of the mind and is in no way a mista ke or a sign
of fai l u re or " not doing it rig ht. " As we have noted before, whenever you
notice that you r attention has d rifted away from sensations in the body,
you might want to let it register that to be awa re of that fact means that
you a re a l ready back and awa ke to what is going on in the mind. In that
very moment, it can be usefu l to gently note what was on you r mind
("th i n king, " "planning," "remembering") and then to reesta blish you r at­
tention on the breath sensations and a sense of the body as a whole.
5 . As best you can, resting in a gentle attending to the actuality of
the field of sensations throughout the body from moment to moment,
and being awa re of any feelings of pleasa ntness, unpleasa ntness, or neu­
tra l ity as they a rise.
6 . The longer the session continues, the more you may experience
sensations a rising that a re particu larly intense in one reg ion of you r body
or a nother, perha ps in the back or in the knees or in the shou lders . With
g reater intensity of sensations, especi a l ly if they feel unpleasant and un­
comforta ble, you may fi nd that you r attention is repeatedly d rawn to
them and away from you r i ntended focus on the breath or the body as a
whole. I n such moments, rather tha n shifting you r postu re (a lthoug h you
a re a lways free to do that, of cou rse), you might experi ment even briefly
with i ntentiona l ly bringing the focus of attention rig ht into the region of
g reatest i ntensity a nd, as best you ca n, exploring with gentle and wise at­
tention the deta i l ed pattern of sensations there-what, precisely, a re the
qualities of the sensations; where, exactly, a re they located; do they va ry
over time or shift a round in the body from one place to a nother? This ex­
ploration is underta ken in the rea l m of sensing and feeling, rather than
through th inking . Again, as best you can, opening to feeling whatever is
a l ready here to be felt, a l lowing you rself to know what you a re feeling via
d i rectly experiencing it. As in the body scan, you may play with using the
breath as a vehicle to ca rry awa reness into such reg ions of intensity,
"breathing in" to them, and out from the m .
7 . Whenever you fi nd you rself "ca rried away" b y t h e intensity of
physica l sensations, or in a ny other way, as best you can reconnect with
the here and now by refocusing attention on the movements of the
breath or on a sense of the body as a whole sitting in a ba la nced and dig­
nified postu re, even i n the midst of the intensity of sensation, g rou nded i n
t h e present moment. N otice how m u c h w e create "pain" out o f discom­
fort through the thoug hts we have a bout it and especi a l ly our thoug hts
a bout how long it is going to last.

TRANSFORMING UNHAPPINESS

New dimensions of the experiences of both pain (physical and
emotional) and suffering and the potential for embracing them and un­
derstanding them differently become available to us when we give our­
selves over to the present moment and let go of all thoughts of the fu­
ture and the past at j ust those moments of highest intensity. You might
experiment with this shift in motivation and awareness even for brief
moments whenever physical or emotional intensity arises in the medi­
tation practice. Just getting one toe in the water for even the briefest of
moments, if that is all you can manage at a certain moment, rather
than j umping into the pool, can be profoundly revealing and poten­
tially healing.

B reath ing Into
The practice of expanding our attention a round the breath to include a
wider awareness of the body as a whole in the sitti ng meditation wi l l pro­
vide many opportu nities to refi ne the ski l l s of "breathing into" that we de­
scribed when we discussed the body sca n in the last chapter (p. 1 05). When
we shift from focusing pri m a rily on the body as a whole, with the breath in
the backg round, to focusing our attention right into the a rea of most in­
tense physica l sensations, there is much to d iscover. Although our attention
may be d rawn to the genera l a rea of i ntensity (as if the mind were shouting
" H ey, look at this ! "), our ha bit of tryi ng to avoid any negative experience
may offer some resista nce to actu a l ly bringing awareness right inta the
most intense physica l sensations and feel i ngs, the epicenter; as it were, of
our discomfort. " B reathing into" can offer a powerfu l a ntidote to experien­
tia l avoidance. The breath can be a vehicle ca rrying a gentle yet penetrat­
ing awareness into the reg ion of intensity. We sense or imagine the breath,
as it moves into the body, conti nuing its movement u nti l it enters the very
core of the reg ion of intensity, ca rryi ng awareness with it.
If the intensity of the sensations becomes overwhe l m i ng, we can sta­
bil ize our attention throug h a complementa ry practice, breathing with , in
which we hold awareness of the intensity together with awareness of the
whole of the breath moving i nto and out of the body somewhat in the
backg round .

Reconnecting with Our Feelings

1 33

B reathing With
Widening the field of awareness, whether to our bodies or to other aspects
of our experience, is sometimes d ifficult beca use there is so m uch going o n :
in our l ives, our m inds, and our bodies. We a re virtua l ly bombarded with
sti m u l i inwa rd ly and outwa rd ly at a l l times except for, perha ps, deep sleep.
H ow, i n this situation, do we combine stability of mind with a wider aware­
ness ? One way is to take adva ntage of the obvious but remarkable fact that
whatever we experience in our l ives is always (and a lways has been) experi­
enced with the activity of the breath in the backg round. This means that, if
we choose, we can sea m l essly weave awareness of the breath in with
awareness of a ny other aspect of our experience. And by doing so, we re­
connect in that moment with our capacity to steady the mind, that ca pac­
ity we were developing earlier as we laid the foundations for mi ndfu lness
practice by focusing on the movements of the breath alone. We ca l l this
practice "breathing with . " By i ncluding an awareness of the breath "in
the backg round" as we focus on any experience, we can steady the mind,
and so attend more easi ly to our actual experience in a ny moment.
For exa m ple, if you were to put on a piece of music right now, you
would probably fi nd that after focusing you r attention on the music for a
while, you r mind wou l d beg i n to wa nder. As an experi ment now or some
other time, you might l i ke to see if you can pay attention to the m usic
and a lso focus, in the backg round, on the breath as it moves in and out
of you r body. Try this for a few m i nutes, perhaps a lternati ng the focus,
fi rst listen i ng to the m usic a lone and then a lso including attention to the
breath in the backg round. It may ta ke some trial and error to fi nd the
most comforta ble way to do this. In particular, it may ta ke a while to
stri ke the right bala nce between the primary focus, the music, in the fore­
g round and the steadyi ng i nfl uence of the breath, in the backg round . But
many find the effort worthwhile beca use it offers us a very versatile way to
steady the mind in complex and d ifficult situations. I n particular, it can be
an inva l uable a l ly and su pport in our intention to expa nd the focus of
awareness to the whole domain of felt bodily experience, when, as may
often ha ppen, this requ i res us to turn towa rd and face intense physica l
sensations and u n pleasa nt feelings.

TRANSFORMING UNHAPPINESS

Maria IS Story
Maria was cleaning up after a visit from her two children. They were in
their mid-twenties and had left home for work and college some years
before. Many of their possessions were still around the house as re­
minders that they would always be welcomed here. They had left that
morning to get their train after a weekend celebrating her fiftieth
birthday; their noise and laughter faded as they disappeared around the
corner of the road. Maria would have to set off for work soon, but she
thought she'd start a bit of laundry and clean one of the bedrooms. As
she went into her son's room, she felt a sense of sadness and loneliness.
"No," she said, "I cannot be sentimental; I 've got to be strong. It's silly
to feel sad." The moment passed; she took the sheets off the bed,
picked up the wastepaper basket, and went downstairs.
Maria had gotten into the habit of dealing with any difficult emo­
tion in this way; it is the way she had coped with a great deal of stress
in her life. This strategy had seemed to work well, but it now meant
that she was cut off from her feelings. She was afraid of experiencing
any emotion lest it overwhelm her. She had begun to feel that she lived
"in parallel" to herself and to those she loved. She always felt a little
cut off, never really engaging with others without being self-conscious
and feeling that she was acting out a part. What she noticed most was
that she was constantly tired, exhausted for no good reason.
At some level she felt that, if she ever started crying, she wouldn't
be able to stop; that she would cry for the whole world, for things and
for people she had lost in her life, for her wrong decisions, for her lost
children, for her unfulfilled ambitions. She would embarrass herself
and let herself down; it would be shameful, uncontrollable. To enter
the dangerous, uncharted territory of emotion was something she had
learned to avoid a long time ago.
Some weeks earlier, Maria had enrolled in our mindfulness pro­
gram. She had enj oyed the body scan and the yoga, though she found
the meditation on the breath very difficult. Her mind kept wandering,
so she did not feel settled in the practice and didn't think it could be
doing her any good.

Reconnecting with Our Feelings

1 35

Then came Session 4. The instructor was leading a meditation
practice that began with focusing on the breath and then expanded the
field of awareness around the breath to include a sense of the body as a
whole. At first Maria was not aware of any body sensations. Then she
registered a sense of something unpleasant, a slight sensation around
the top of her stomach, j ust below the ribcage in the middle of her
body. It was not strong, nor painful, but it was there: a sort of empty
feeling, a slight stretching at the edges, unpleasant to focus on, but in­
teresting in that she had never noticed it before. As she held this bun­
dle of sensations in awareness, she was aware of the image of her son
and daughter, then an image of their empty rooms in the house. The
sensations passed, and for the first time in her life she left that session
feeling more intrigued by an unpleasant feeling state than afraid of it.
Now, a few days later, and in her empty house after the children
had left, she emptied the wastepaper basket and went upstairs to put it
back. Once again, she felt a wave of sadness. But this time, rather than
chasing it away, she allowed herself to sit on the edge of the bed and
tune in to wherever these feelings were affecting her body. She became
aware of the feeling j ust below the ribcage and felt a tiredness in her
arms and legs. She held all these sensations in awareness and for the
first time was able to get a sense of space around them, as if air was
moving around, under, and over the sensations. She started to cry but
did not try to stop it. She felt lonely but did not try to deny it to her­
self. She felt angry with herself and her husband but did not feel that it
was wrong to feel this way. She found that she was sobbing but did not
feel either out of control or in control-the issue of control seemed ir­
relevant. It must have been one or two minutes later when the crying
changed; there were moments of quiet, and a stillness; then some more
tears, and then again, the stillness. Somehow she felt at peace, al­
though nothing had changed. And she wasn't afraid anymore. She got
up, put the wastepaper basket in the corner of the room, and went to
get ready to go to work.
For Maria, the practice of widening attention around the breath to
include a sense of her whole body offered a way to move beyond her
habitual avoidance to a willingness to experience what was on her

1 36

mind and what she was carrying in her body. There are many different
ways in which we can reconnect with ignored or pushed away aspects
of ourselves. By sampling a range of mindfulness practices over time,
we can ultimately each find our own unique way back to befriending
and learning from our full range of emotions. In that spirit, let's look at
two more practices that might help us be more mindful and more ac­
cepting of our sometimes elusive feelings.

Becoming Awa re of the Plea sant and U n plea sant
Qualities of Experience
H ow ca n we become more awa re of feelings (pleasa nt, unpleasa nt, or
neutra l ) a nd of the physica l sensations i n our bod ies in our daily l ives ?
You might l i ke to try th is:
Over the next few hours, be on the lookout for even the smal lest
moments when you reg ister an experience as " pleasa nt" or " u n p leasa nt. "
You can use the Pleasa nt and U n pleasant Event Calendars on pages 235-

236 and 238-239 to keep a record of what was actua l ly going on in
the moment in question, with pa rticu lar attention to the i nterplay of feel­
ings, thoug hts, and physica l sensations d u ring each event. Record ing what
you were actua l ly experiencing i n each insta nce ca n be very va luable.

Making a commitment to be aware of pleasant or unpleasant feel­
ings in any moment requires that we be sensitive to what is actually go­
ing on for us inwardly. Of course, this requires tuning in, the exact oppo­

site of experiential avoidance. Forming the explicit intention to be aware
of what is pleasant or unpleasant in a particular experience and how it
feels in the body, in the heart, and in the mind can not only help us to
become more aware of the actuality of our experience, but also begin to
reverse the automatic habit of experiential avoidance.
This was exactly Sam's experience when, as part of the mindfulness
course in which he was participating, he had spent a week looking out for
pleasant moments in his everyday life. His experiential avoidance had
been so extreme that he often found himself falling asleep when he was
not busying himself with one thing or another, even though he was not

and engaged; he smiled. When participants were invited to report back

on their experience with the Pleasant Events Calendar, Sam described
how he had discovered that his life was far richer in pleasant events than
he had imagined: the smile of a passing acquaintance, the reflections of
trees on water. Without making any changes to the actual pattern of his
day, Sam had discovered many small sources of happiness that were al­
ready there in his life, waiting to be found. All he needed to do was to deThe B right Field

liberately tune his attention to what had always been available to him.
This availability was revealed only when he deliberately focused on his
world around him and was more prepared to experience feelings. Natu­
rally, he was happy; but that was not the main point of the exercise. What
Sam was exploring was how to take the risk of engaging with moment-to­
moment living as it actually was, rather than tuning out of it for fear of
what it might become.

READING YO UR O WN BAROM ETER

Our colleague, Trish Bartley, has developed a practice designed to bring
awareness of feelings into our everyday lives. She calls the practice the
"Physical Barometer," and the instructions for it follow, with her per­
mission. By first directing attention to a general area of the body ( such
as the torso) and then asking us to identify a particular pattern of sub­
tle bodily sensations within that general area (a combination of physi­
cal body sensations and the intuitive feelings of pleasantness/unpleas­
antness/neutrality ) , these instructions allow us to discover what is
often a previously unsuspected resource. For many, this resource has
provided very helpful guidance and enrichment for everyday life.

The Physica l Barometer
If you have a barometer or have ever seen someone consu lt one, you wi l l
know that first you ta p gently o n the g lass a n d then you look to see which
way the need le inside the g lass moves. If the need le moves u p, the a i r
pressure is rising and t h e weather wil l probably improve, and i f t h e nee­
dle goes down, it may be going to rai n . But things va ry accord i ng to sea­
sons, so it is quite complicated to predict the weather.
We can use our bodies in a similar way to g ive us very sensitive infor­
mation a bout how things a re for us, at a ny g iven moment.
Here is how you can do this:
1 . Determine some part of the body-such as the chest a rea or the
a bdomen or somewhere in between the two-that for you is especia l ly
sensitive to stress and d ifficu lty.

We have touched on a number of reasons why we might choose to
put time and effort into cultivating a wider and deeper awareness of our
bodily experience: it connects us with the here and now; it reduces ex­
periential avoidance and enables us to connect more fully with life; it
allows us to process body sensations and feelings less automatically; it
disrupts the vicious cycles that fuel unhappiness and bias our thoughts
and j udgments.
The point of recognizing when situations evoke unpleasant feel­
ings, or when our contracted bodies tell us we have already reacted
with aversion, is so we can then learn how to respond more skillfully.
Can we learn how to be with an unpleasant feeling in a way that is not
going to get us trapped in obsessive preoccupation, endless cycles of ru­
mination, and thus persistent unhappiness and depression ? Can we
transform our very relationship to our emotions ? It is to this possibility
that we turn in the next chapter.

Befriending Our Feelings
How could we forget those ancient myths that stand at
the beginning of all races-the myths about dragons that
at the last moment are transformed into princesses.
Perhaps all the dragons in our lives are only princesses
waiting for us to act, j ust once, with beauty and courage.
Perhaps everything that frightens us is, in its deepest
essence, something helpless that wants our love.
So you must not be frightened if a sadness rises before
you larger than any you've ever seen, if an anxiety like
light and cloud shadows moves over your hands and
everything that you do. You must realize that something
has happened to you; that life has not forgotten you; it
holds you in its hands and will not let you fall. Why do
you want to shut out of your life any uneasiness, any
miseries, or any depressions ? For after all, you do not know
what work these conditions are doing inside you.

knows that there will b e obstacles along the way that may seem insur­
mountable. Climbers train for months, knowing that gentle slopes will
give way to large overhangs that look impossible to scale. They pore
over detailed maps until they can see the terrain they'll cover in their
sleep. Still, no amount of preparation entirely eliminates the challenge
of the real thing. Every climb has one overhang that can seem impossi­
ble when confronted. We have now reached j ust such a critical j unc­
ture in our quest to reverse the cycle of unhappiness.

Befriending Our Feelings

The challenge before us at this point is to see if we can be with our
unwanted emotions without making them worse. The very notion may
seem strange and the task impossible because we so easily fall into aver­
sion and the doing mode. Yet such an intentional, conscious gesture,
which amounts to a paradoxical embrace of what we fear most, can be
a powerfully liberating act. Yes, the mind's readiness to leap in to meet
difficult emotions in problem-solving mode, its aversion to unpleasant
experiences, and our reflexive self-castigating response to even fleeting
sadness may all stand in our way. But mountain climbers reach "impos­
sible" heights all the time by using the skills and knowledge they have de­

veloped in the course of their training. Working through this book offers
training in exactly the skills and the knowledge needed right now to
address the challenge of our most difficult emotional states.
In the last chapter, we explored a group of exercises that can help
us tune in to the body's signals of aversion and unpleasantness. We may
have gotten so adept at avoiding negative emotions in the past that we
no longer recognize them or the aversion that would serve as our "get­
away car." In this chapter, we'll go one step further and learn to recog­

nize, approach, accept, and befriend those emotions so that they do not so
easily trigger a downward spiral into depression.
Befriending emotions that we've viewed as the "enemy" for so
long may run counter to all of our self-preservation instincts. But,
when it comes right down to it, what else is there to do ? The alterna­
tive so far has been to struggle and suffer whenever things have not
gone as we had hoped they would. Perhaps it's time to explore another
path.
We are not claiming that cultivating mindfulness in the face of a
tendency toward sadness, low mood, and depressive rumination is easy.
But it is doable. What is more, it draws on what is deepest and best in
us. In this book we offer many suggestions for relating more skillfully
to unpleasant experience. But ultimately, through the cultivation of
mindfulness, each of us will discover our own ways to transform our re­
lationship with what we find unpleasant, difficult, and threatening.
Making use of the mindfulness practices we have already de­
scribed, we are well on the way to reversing our habitual rej ection of

1 42

TRAN SFOR M I N G UNHAPPINESS

the difficult and the unpleasant. Bringing a gentle openness and inter­
est to something troublesome is, in itself, an enormously important
part of acceptance. It will be invaluable if we can remind ourselves,
again and again, of a simple but powerful truth: Intentionally holding
something in awareness is already an affirmation that it can be faced,
named, and worked with. In fact, it is also an immediate embodiment of
facing it, naming it, and working with it.

PLACING OUR TRUS T I N BO DY AWARENESS

The key here is to uncouple our experience of unpleasant feelings from
the knee-j erk reaction of aversion that habitually follows it-or, if we
are already caught up in aversion, to free ourselves from its grip. Just as
we were able to focus on body sensations to help us identify aversive
reactions, we can work mainly through the body to respond more effec­
tively to the events that trigger aversion. Working through the body
keeps difficulties in play long enough for us to discover that even
the worst circumstances we find ourselves in are indeed workable.
This is particularly crucial to keep in mind when every fiber of our
instinctual being is telling us to fix or get rid of the difficulty as
quickly as possible.
Whenever something unpleasant arises, the systems in the brain
that warn us about potential threats are activated: it is as if a loud
alarm is sounded, and the mind gives high priority to attending to
whatever caused the unpleasantness. We may do many things to try to
distract ourselves-such as turning on the TV-but the alarm is insis­
tent and doesn't shut off. Worries keep intruding on our consciousness.
Sooner or later, with the TV on or off, the disturbing thoughts and
feelings come flooding back.
Here is that critical moment. If, paradoxically, we can turn and

face whatever it is that we are finding scary, difficult, or depressing
rather than perpetually distracting ourselves to no avail, we are actu­
ally still doing what the brain wants us to do: giving high-priority at­
tention to the matter at hand. It's j ust that we are no longer giving it

Befriending Our Feelings

1 43

attention in the old "doing" way. We are approaching the moment­
whatever it is, however it is-not by reacting but rather by responding,
by bringing an open, spacious , and affectionate attention to the feeling in
the moment

as

it expresses itself in the body. Now we are in relationship

to the alarm in a new way, one that provides us with a viable alterna­
tive to endlessly thinking about it.
By now we have seen time and again how we react automatically
to difficult emotions by triggering the doing mode of mind, so domi­
nated by thinking. The sequence may begin with our worrying about
all the things that could go wrong and would make things worse, and
then move on to what to do about it. We dig up old memories and get
caught in the stream of endless rumination. Because these reactions all
register as "unpleasant" on our internal barometer, another uncon­
scious cycle of aversion is triggered.
But now there is another possibility. The very fact that we are
learning to read this internal barometer and can be aware of this at­
tempt to push away the unpleasant, and that we can locate the ac­
companying uncomfortable sensations in the body-as muscle tighten­
ing and overall contracting, or bracing-gives us the opportunity to
use this information from the body to break the downward spiral into
rumination and depression. We do this by trusting ourselves to hold diffi­

cult feeling states in awareness--an awareness that includes how it feels in
the body . By opening up even the tiniest bit of breathing room­
between the experience of "unpleasant" when first detected and the
tendency to react almost instantaneously with aversion-we give
ourselves powerful and precious opportunities to nourish and shape
our ability to see and respond to what is happening. We tap into the
deep wisdom in our own mind, a wisdom that does not rely on
thought, to respond to difficulties in ways that can be transformative
and freeing. Here's how:
Once we notice an unpleasant feeling, we focus, as best we can, on

how we experience it in the body . This is aided enormously by connecting
our awareness of the breath in that very moment with whatever the
unpleasant experience is-what we were calling in Chapter 6 the ges­
ture of "breathing with." This breathing with whatever arises in and of

1 44

TRAN SFORMING UNHAPPIN ESS

itself tends to steady the mind. As we learned in Chapter 6 , it involves
expanding the awareness of our breath sensations to include awareness
of other relevant sensations we are experiencing in the body. Prac­
ticing in this way includes intentionally breathing in to any area of pain­
ful or uncomfortable sensations, exploring its "edges" and any changes
in intensity, and allowing our awareness to simply hold it all. In such a
moment, we have an opportunity to recognize any signs of aversion
manifested in the body as contraction. Tying awareness of the breath to
awareness of other sensations in the body makes the breath a vehicle
for the movement of awareness j ust as it was in the body scan. But
since this awareness can also hold thoughts and feelings, if those
should arise, the field of awareness can readily recognize and accommo­
date them as well, without having to do anything at all. The awareness
itself does all the work.
We can start to learn this new way to relate to unpleasant sensa­
tions and feelings through the mindful yoga introduced in the last
chapter. You may like to read the following section and then put the
book down for a few minutes and do some of these stretches, following
along with the CD (Track 3 ) . As best you can, approach these
stretches in the spirit we now describe.

WORKING THE EDGE
We almost inevitably encounter at least some degree of bodily discom­
fort in key places when we practice stretching through mindful yoga.
This is what makes this practice such an effective vehicle for learning
how to approach difficult and unwanted moments and experiences
with greater acceptance, curiosity, gentleness, and kindness. What is
more, the new skills we develop in working with even a mild degree of
physical discomfort can be directly applied later to situations of emo­
tional discomfort, however intense they may be.
Let's imagine we have our hands above our heads, we are stretch­
ing upward with our whole bodies, and it is beginning to feel uncom­
fortable in our shoulders and upper arms. One way to react ( the avoid-

Befriending Our Feelings

1 45

ance option) is to back off as soon as we feel any discomfort, perhaps
immediately lowering our arms and turning our attention to some
other part of the body or even out of the body altogether, maybe into a
stream of thoughts or images. Another possibility ( the unkind option) is
to grit our teeth, tell ourselves we j ust have to put up with the increas­
ing pain and discomfort, and not make a fuss, as if this were the aim of
the practice. We would then put even more effort into pushing our­
selves to stretch further. Here, too, we are likely to numb out, remov­
ing our awareness from those regions of the body experiencing the dis­
comfort.
But there is also a third option, one that strikes a balance between
withdrawing at the first sign of discomfort and forcing ourselves to
meet some self-designated standard of endurance. This mindful option
calls for approaching the situation in a spirit of gentle nurturing, using
the stretch to extend our ways of relating to discomfort. We direct our
attention right into the area of discomfort as best we can, using the
breath as a vehicle to bring awareness right into that region, as in the
body scan. With a gentle curiosity we then explore what we find
there-physical sensations and feelings, coming, going, and changing.
We sense them directly, perhaps focusing on any changes in intensity
over time. The idea is not to hold a posture until it is painful. It is
rather to experience the limit of the movement in any particular
stretch or posture and then to linger there without forcing or pushing
through strong sensations. All the while we keep our attention on the
sensations and feelings themselves, as best we can. We focus on the
physical qualities of the sensations, on any sense of tightness, holding,
burning, trembling, or shaking, breathing with the sensations, as best we
can. We allow our thoughts about what these feelings mean to simply
come and go in awareness.
We can play with the intensity of sensation by actually varying
the stretch itself, experimenting with working the edge of our dis­
comfort and our acceptance, exploring for ourselves j ust how the
body responds directly to every tiny change we introduce. This ap­
proach gives us some sense of being able to modulate the intensity of
unpleasant sensations. This is also a way we can be gentle and nur-

1 46

TRANSFORMING UNHAPPINESS

turing toward ourselves while still learning how to relate to whatever
arises in a new way. We don't try to force things beyond our limit of
the moment.
The body provides a wonderful arena in which we can directly
witness the effects of aversion and the power of an accepting awareness
to dissolve it. For example, as we continue to hold our arms stretched
out above our heads and we become aware of an increasing sense of dis­
comfort, we might invite ourselves to briefly scan the body to see if we
can pick up regions where the muscles are tense and contracted, even
though they are not directly involved in holding up the arms. It is quite
common to become aware of tension and contraction in the face, such
as the j aw or forehead. Clearly, these regions are making no essential
contribution to holding the arms up. Why, then, are they contracted ?
Their contraction is simply a sign that we are reacting with aversion to
the experience of discomfort. Knowing this, we can breathe a gentle,
curious, nurturing attention into these regions of the body on the in­
breath while on the out-breath we allow ourselves to let go of any sense
of resistance or holding. As best we can, we let any tension leave with
the out-breath, to the extent that it will. In all likelihood, a sense of
increased ease and lightness in the face will give us direct feedback that
we have mindfully released ourselves, to one degree or another, from
our automatic habit of tensing and bracing in aversion against discom­
fort.
Mindful stretching provides a very useful training ground for ex­
ploring new counterintuitive ways to respond to discomfort. It also offers, in itself, an invalu­

instance, and perhaps re­

cover our clarity of mind j ust by attending to the body's movements
and sensations over a relatively short period of time. When our mood

Befriending Our Feelings

147

has deteriorated, when we may be finding it difficult to concentrate, it
is helpful to be able to ground ourselves in awareness of the tangible
sensations that arise as we stretch and twist and work with our bodies.
This gentle yet always challenging physical activity can also have a di­
rect enlivening and arousing effect that may cut through the lethargy
that can rear its head as unhappiness deepens. In fact, it is very difficult
to remain sad or anxious while doing yoga in a mindful way. It is as if
we were literally and metaphorically sweeping the body clean-and,
along with it, the mind.

Working the Edge in Sitting Meditation
We saw in Chapter 6 how we might run into a certain degree of dis­
comfort in the sitting meditation simply by being still for an extended
period of time, even more so when sitting cross-legged on the floor.
One or both knees, the back, neck, or shoulders might start to ache,
and the ache can intensify with time, sometimes quite dramatically.
Recall that the sitting meditation invites us to first let our attention
settle on the breath sensations themselves, and then gradually expand
the field of awareness once it is relatively stable, to include a sense of
the body as a whole or any particular regions that might be giving rise
to intense sensations. So here is another effective opportunity, j ust as
in the mindful yoga, to develop our ability to work the edge, befriend­
ing our experience in the body by turning toward and opening to what­
ever is present, even if our initial reaction is strong aversion. As we saw
in Chapter 6, when our attention is repeatedly drawn to such uncom­
fortable sensations, we can include those areas of greatest intensity
within the field of awareness and experience them moment by moment
j ust as they are, even if it is j ust for a few moments at first. Here we are
again, working the edge, gently and lovingly zeroing in on our bound­
aries and limits by moving into and embracing the sensations them­
selves, until we sense that we have reached our limit for the moment.
Then we intentionally and caringly back off, and shift our attention
from the region of greatest intensity, ready to return when we have

1 48

TRAN SFORM ING UNHAPPINESS

gathered and regrouped our resources. We might do this in a number
of ways:
•

One possibility is to shift attention within the general region of

intensity; rather than focusing on the region of maximum intensity, we
focus on an area of lesser intensity.
•

Another possibility is to breathe with the discomfort, holding

awareness of the intense sensations together with awareness of the
breath, in the background.
•

Or, if the intensity is becoming overwhelming, we can shift the

focus of attention away from that region entirely and focus attention
exclusively on the breath.
•

And we always have the option of moving the body intention­

ally, of shifting our posture during the sitting meditation practice if the
intensity becomes too great. This is an act of kindness and intelligence
in itself and not a measure of failure . And we can be aware of shifting
our posture too, so that there is a continuity of awareness regardless of
how we are responding to the intensity of sensation.
The point here is that the practice itself allows us to discover dif­
ferent ways to stay in relationship to our inner experience, even when
it is unpleasant and difficult. It reminds us that we don't have to throw
ourselves in all at once. It's more like dipping j ust the big toe in the wa­
ter to test the temperature.

Anthony's Story
Anthony's experience illustrates the transformation that cultivating
mindfulness makes possible. He had come to mindfulness classes be­
cause he felt constantly tense and ill at ease. Yet focusing on his body had
simply made him more aware of his discomfort. He could not j ust "be
with" the feelings of tension in his body at first. He kept wanting things
to be different and was frustrated that he did not feel any better when he
tried to meditate. Then one day while walking in the woods his dog dis­
turbed a hornets' nest. After dragging his dog away, Anthony found his
own leg covered in the insects. Several stung him, and he had to get
home quickly to put on some ointment. After a day or two, the stings had
stopped being painful but had become intensely itchy. Anthony had
been told emphatically not to scratch, but he could hardly bear it, so
strong was the itch. He decided to experiment with bringing his aware­
ness to the itching and discomfort, "breathing into it" to investigate it
more closely. He noticed that the itching was not j ust one sensation but
many. What's more, this bundle of sensations changed from moment to
moment, some of the sensations shifting rapidly, some more slowly.
Later, Anthony was able to apply the skills he had developed in
dealing with the physical discomfort of itching to discomfort related
more directly to emotion. When his body felt tense, rather than get­
ting fed up or trying to ignore it, he was now able to stay inside the ten­
sion, breathing with it, moving up close to it, in intimate contact with
the various sensations associated with it. He found that he was able to
bring a greater sense of compassion toward his body and a more accept­
ing attitude toward himself.
Anthony was learning the difference between avoiding ( shutting
himself off from experience) and approaching the difficult ( being open
to experience ) . He discovered that the difference can be very subtle,
yet very liberating. Such a sense of freedom comes because the shift
from avoidance to openness is accompanied by a shift from the brain
pattern that underlies avoidance to a new brain pattern that underlies
approach. As in the mouse-in-the-maze experiment this new pattern
allows for a greater flexibility of response.

ances out the brain's tendency to switch into its avoidance pattern with
a pattern associated with "welcoming. "
Mindful awareness and learning t o b e with unpleasant feelings are
not about striving for some ideal of happiness in the face of the
difficult-that would be j ust another goal we are fixating on. Rather, it
is as if we are bathing the difficult situation, and even our aversion to
it, in an open, compassionate, and accepting awareness, j ust like a
mother embracing a suffering child. We can take this stance not only
toward physical discomfort but also toward emotional discomfort.

TRANSFO RM ING DIFFICULT EMO TIO NS

Unpleasant emotions are invariably accompanied by sensations and
feelings in the body. If we gently focus our attention right into these ar­
eas of intense sensation and discomfort, we bring about both immedi­
ate and longer term effects. We immediately short-circuit any unhelp­
ful avoidance tendencies of the mind. We also disrupt the automatic
links among body sensations, feelings, and thoughts that perpetuate vi­
cious cycles and downward mood spirals. In the longer run, we develop
more skillful ways of being in relationship to uncomfortable experi­
ences. Rather than seeing them as "bad and threatening things," a view
that triggers avoidance and gets us stuck in suffering, we begin to see
unpleasant experiences for what they are: passing mental events­
bundles of bodily sensations, feelings, and thoughts. As best we can, we
greet them with a sense of interest and curiosity, rather than with a
sense of unease, hatred, and dread. We welcome them in, as they are
already here anyway.

In the MBCT program, we have specifically designed a practice
for investigating the texture of emotionally challenging situations. The
practice helps us explore and cultivate more skillful responses in those
critical moments. We start by deliberately inviting a difficult scenario
or circumstance to come to mind. We then work with it in the body,
bringing awareness to it, breathing into it, and discovering a wider
space within which it might exist. The instructions follow. We suggest
that you settle by focusing on the breath and body for a few minutes
before starting to follow the instructions.

ening the awareness to ta ke in the body as a whole (see Sitting Med ita­

When you a re ready, see if you can bring to mind a difficu lty that is
going on i n you r l ife at the moment, something you don't mind staying
with for a short while. It does not have to be very i m portant or critica l, but
it should be something that you a re awa re of as somewhat unpleasa nt,
something u n resolved . Perhaps a misunderstanding or an a rgument, a
situation where you feel somewhat ang ry, reg retful, or g u i lty over some­
thing that has ha ppened . If nothing comes to m ind, perhaps you might
choose something from the past, either recent or dista nt, that once
caused unpleasantness.

where the sensations a re strongest in the gestu re of a n em brace, a wel­

on the in-breath and breathing out from that reg ion on the out-breath,
exploring the sensations, watching their intensity shift up and down from
one moment to the next.

Amanda 's Story
Amanda, a participant in our program, had trouble with this practice
at first. When asked to bring a difficult situation to mind, her first reac­
tion was "I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do this. I can't think of
anything." She got worried that she was going to miss out on this exer­
cise. Then suddenly something came into her mind. It had to do with
her son.
"He's been giving us a really hard time recently-staying out all
hours, hanging around with people we don't trust. We had a real crisis

Befriending Our Feelings

1 53

two months ago involving the police. As soon as this came into my
mind I knew this was going to be difficult to get out of my mind again. I
try not to think about it at all, but every time I do, I think Where have I

gone wrong?"
Amanda believes she won't be able to get this difficulty out of her
mind because her experience is that she has "failed" at it before. She is
now j udging and blaming herself, questioning what she has done to
produce this dilemma. Notice that this troubling situation immediately
sets off the driven mode of thinking that we call "rumination."
The next instruction, to focus on body sensations and feelings,
was very difficult for her. Initially it was as though her breathing had
stopped completely. Then she recognized that large areas of her body
were extremely tense. Normally, she would have tried desperately to
think of something else-to distract herself, to think positively. But
here she was being invited to bring attention to, and to breathe into,
those regions in her body that felt most tense. Realizing j ust how tense
she was in that moment, Amanda purposefully expanded her attention
to include the whole body and breathed into the places where the ten­
sion and contraction were most intense.
Then something happened that was totally unexpected. She sud­
denly became aware that she could give those feelings some room. "It
suddenly became like a great big empty space, with the air coming in
and out," she said. "You know, sometimes when you come back from a
vacation and the house is a bit musty, so you open all the doors and
windows to let the air blow through ? Well, it was like that-having
doors and windows open, and with curtains blowing and air was com­
ing in and out. And it was really amazing. The tension about my son
was still there. I thought, Oh , you're still there , but never mind-the

wind's blowing through , and that's all right. "
The unexpected difference seemed to be that Amanda could look
at the difficulty. The feeling in her body was still a bit tight, but the
area of tension seemed to be much smaller, with a sense that the air
could flow around it.
Amanda's experience shows that it is indeed possible to work with

think of meditation as a clever way to get rid of these frightening states
of mind. But it is important to keep in mind that mindfulness is not
about getting rid of anything, nor is it about "not having" such feelings
arise in the first place. Rather, the intention behind cultivating mind­
fulness of emotional states is to learn how we can relate to them in
ways that will not get us stuck in unhappiness. One way of knowing
that we are on the right track is having a sense of spaciousness in how
we are holding these feelings. The feelings are still here, in this very
moment, j ust as they were for Amanda, but it is as if, somehow, they do
not take up all the space in the mind. They are seen and held in a
greater awareness, an awareness that is discerning and openhearted.
And, interestingly enough-and this is something that you can explore
for yourself and play with-the awareness itself is not in pain, or un­
happy, or caught in any way at all.
Amanda's description of her experience with her particular diffi­
culty is revealing. "To begin with," she said, "it was like a solid mass of
rock. It was huge. It was so solid that you couldn't get around it, but
then it shrank to a small stone. It was still stone, but it was small. It's
really good. Because I think probably I have been pushing the issue
away, sort of sitting on it and not letting it come up fully to the surface.
I haven't allowed it before to simply be here. I thought it would j ust
overwhelm me. It was too much to let in, and so my natural reaction

Meg's Story
The point of the practice we have j ust described is to provide, within
the laboratory of a therapeutic program and the meditation practice it­
self, opportunity after opportunity to explore and develop more effec­
tive ways of responding to unpleasant feelings and emotions. These
skills, developed in this admittedly highly contained formal learning
situation, can then be used where they are really needed: in our every­
day lives. Sometimes the effects can be quite dramatic, as Meg found
out:
"I awoke yesterday feeling really angry. I was fuming. I knew ex­
actly what it was about. The day before I had had a meeting with my
supervisor (I was doing an evening course to get qualified-well, we've
all got to do a proj ect ) . She had promised to read my draft proj ect
write-up before we met so she could give me feedback on it. The dead­
line is coming up soon, and I had lots of other work to do, so I needed
her comments now so I could work on it over the holiday. When I got
there, she apologized and said she hadn't been able to get to it yet.
She'd been away, etc., etc. She flicked through it and gave me some
general comments for how to redraft it and said I'd be fine. The meet­
ing finished, and I felt pretty much okay about it. I decided to start re­
drafting it the next morning and went to bed. That was the day before
yesterday.
"But the morning after I'd seen her, I woke up really bitter. I had
all these angry thoughts going round and round in my head: She knew
when the draft was arriving; she just doesn't care . Perhaps she doesn't
want to supervise me . Well, if that's how she feels , I'll leave the course . I
don't have to continue . I ' ll simply leave a note for her and tell her I'm not
coming back to the class . She ' ll be sorry then . I told myself that I was
stupid to be thinking like this, that I was overreacting. But as soon as
I thought I had calmed down, another angry thought would come, or
I would imagine her opening my note or imagine me walking out of
college.
"I suppose I lay there for about five minutes, fuming away. Then I

TRANSFORMING UNHAPPINESS

1 56

remembered something we had learned about what to do when we get
locked into this sort of self-talk: about moving away from thinking­
and shifting awareness to how the thoughts and emotions were felt in
my body. I shifted my attention to my body and was able to feel, very
clearly, a tightness in my chest and stomach. I lay in bed and simply
held in awareness the sense of these feelings as they were occurring in
my body. The next moment the sensations were gone and with them
the anger. Just like that, in a flash. I couldn't believe it; like a soap bub­
ble I had j ust touched-and it disappeared.
"I got up, went over to my desk, turned on my computer, and
worked on redrafting the proj ect. Although from time to time since, I
still think of her not reading the work, it does not have the same ability
to charge me up."
This almost looks like magic. Indeed, people who have been
through mindfulness-based training programs sometimes use words
such as miracle to describe experiences like Meg's. As mindfulness
develops, we can more and more observe thoughts and emotions as
if they were bubbles rising from the bottom of a pot of boiling wa­
ter; we simply watch as they burst at the surface. It sometimes feels
as if the awareness itself, in touching the thought or feeling, makes
it go "poof," j ust like Meg's soap bubble. Tibetans sometimes say
in this regard that thoughts "self-liberate" in the field of pure aware­
ness.
Meg's experience shows that, when we experience difficult and
unwanted emotions, we can transform our experience by intention­
ally bringing a kindly/allowing awareness to these feelings and emo­
tions as they are experienced in the body. Once more, we see that
cultivating awareness by working through the body in the very mo­
ments that the first inklings of emotional reactivity arise allows us to
sidestep a possible descent into persistent unhappiness and depres­
sion. It provides a way to be with any persisting unpleasant feelings
without struggle, offering the possibility of fully experiencing being
alive, even in the midst of whatever difficulties we are challenged
with.

TAKING THE PATH
OF HO NES TY AND O PENNESS

By now it should be clear that working with difficulty through the
body does not mean j ust grimly thinking about its awfulness. Mind­
fulness is hardly an exercise in either stoicism or thinking. Anthony,
Amanda, and Meg had the courage to bring full awareness, coupled
with elements of curiosity and self-compassion, to their experience.
As a result, their relationship to their difficult emotions shifted dra­
matically.
In the past, the tensions that they each felt in their bodies were
associated with trying to protect themselves from being overwhelmed
by such difficult feelings. But all that did was to freeze the normal un­
folding and resolution of an emotional process. Aversion and avoid­
ance, and all the tension that surrounds them, prevent us from moving
beyond old wounds and old habits of self-criticism.
Gaining the basic confidence to let down our habitual and in­
stinctive defenses unconditionally in the face of difficulty is certainly
bound to take some time. Sometimes, particularly in those who have
survived severe trauma, doing this kind of work effectively requires a
protected and highly supportive therapeutic environment. Each of us
needs to choose a pace at which we can work the edge of painful and
difficult feelings, especially if they involve painful memories. Turning
toward such feelings and being willing to experience them is a very
brave thing to do, but it can also seem like a crazy thing to do since it
runs counter to all our commonsense instincts for self-preservation. In
the final analysis, however, if we want freedom from the habitual reac­
tivity of the mind, we may have no choice - in the end, the path of
honesty and genuine openness may be the only path that offers healing
and resolution. The alternatives may j ust not go deep enough or may
suffer from lack of authenticity.
This attitude of radical acceptance is expressed simply and pro­
foundly in the poem "The Guest House" by Rumi, a 1 3th-century Sufi
poet.

1 58

TRANSFORM ING UNHAPPINESS

This being human is a guest house.
Every morning a new arrival.
A joy, a depression, a meanness,

The beauty of bringing a wider moment-by-moment awareness to
an old wound, a current pain, or a difficulty is that it opens up new pos­

afresh. Let's allow the difficulty to be here-I'll j ust be with it now, in
each moment, as if it were a sick child in the middle of the night that
needs to be held tenderly and reassured."
In mindfulness practice, a spirit of gentleness and tenderness is
combined with a spirit of adventure and discovery: "Let's see what is in

lems of next week, next year, and the rest of our lives, which we so re­
flexively fall into doing. If our thoughts persuade us that our lives will
always be like this ( "This is just how I am") , then what started with pain
or tension or sadness is going to give rise to even greater suffering. But
if we're j ust here for this moment, and in this moment, with these
thoughts and feelings and body sensations, and now in the very next
moment the mind's patterns are changed in some way, and now,
changed again in the very next moment, events have a chance to un­
fold in an entirely different way. And yet it is always now, and therefore
always "workable" in the very same way as "The Guest House" is sug­
gesting.

The Wisdom to Be Gained
from Being with Diffic ult Emotions
Suspending j udgments and shifting our perception of difficult emotions
can help us enormously. Unpleasant emotions are an ever-changing
constellation of physical sensations, thoughts, and feelings, j ust as
pleasant ones are. They seem to have a life of their own, but they can
be met and embraced in awareness. Coming to terms with our emo­
tions means seeing deeply into them. At the heart of healing, and of
the healing gesture we make toward ourselves, is gentle, kind accep­
tance of whatever we find right in the midst of the difficulty itself.
These discoveries can be surprising. We might find that fear keeps ris­
ing to the surface of our awareness even when we are not conscious of
being afraid of anything in particular. We might notice, for the first
time, a deep aching emptiness. Perhaps we'll find that a dull ache that
seems to be with us all the time in fact ebbs and flows, rises and falls,
and is composed of a variety of feelings that we would not describe as
an ache at all. Just knowing and radically accepting that these feelings
are part of us in this moment can help keep the mind from turning on
the "aversion switch" that leads to desperate brooding over how to get
rid of the feelings.
A focus on the sheer physicality of difficult experiences can catalyze
this important shift in perception. It can also help us become familiar

1 60

TRAN SFORM ING UNHAPPINESS

with our own specific, distinctive pattern of bodily sensations that signal
aversion. Learning to recognize these patterns helps us identify them
more quickly. Then, seeing that characteristic pattern as it pops up
time after time in our lives can powerfully support the view of difficult
emotions as neither a problem nor a threat . . . and aversion itself as
simply an old habit. Eventually, we may even recognize it simply as a
very familiar and frequent visitor: "Oh, here you are again. " By witness­
ing, over and over again, the effects this visitor has on us, we may begin to
see ever more clearly that such visitations do no good at all for us or for
anyone else and also that they are nowhere near as powerful as we some­
times think, in spite of all the misery they can carry with them. This real­
ization can help ease us out of the grip in which aversion can hold us.
It also affects our experience of suffering. Whether you will still be
in pain after you begin to practice mindful awareness is impossible to
say. We can know a moment only when

openness that Rumi invokes, it will be
more bearable than otherwise. There may still be pain, but there also
may be less suffering.
By bringing mindful awareness to what is actually unfolding in our
experience, we're not necessarily going to change the rock-bottom sen­
sations in the body. But there is every chance that we will see what's
going on with greater accuracy and precision. And that gives us the
power of choice. We can decide to be in an entirely different relation­
ship to old mental habits. We can decide either to open to all the sad
or angry thoughts and feelings with awareness, as suggested in "The
Guest House," or to succumb to our habitual tendency to withdraw and
turn away.
Our old habits may try to persuade us that avoiding the difficult is
necessary. But this is not true. There is an alternative. We can free our­
selves from the things that hold us down and hold us back. Once we
know how to look, we will see that our world holds much more promise
than we might have imagined from inside the prison of our discontent.

S eeing Thoughts as Creations
of the Mind

Imagine you are twelve years old and in school. The day is dragging,
but you brighten up when you remember that it's Wednesday . Your dad
has promised to pick you up after school to take you to buy new running
shoes . It's been seven months since your mom and dad split up . You
miss your dad , and so you look forward to these shopping trips .
After school, you don't wait for the bus with the other kids . You
stay in the school building for a while and then wander out toward the
road . Your dad's not there , but that's okay . He ' ll have been held up . He
never misses . Ten , then fifteen , minutes go by , and you see some of
your teachers in their cars leaving the school. One of them stops to ask if
you're okay , and you say "Fine . " Half an hour later, it's starting to get
dark . All the school buses have long since left.
You start to worry about where your father is . Has he had an acci­
dent? Has he forgotten you? Surely not . You wish you had your cell
phone and could call him . You remember other times you've felt alone .
You start to feel miserable . You wonder where everything went wrong.
School hasn't been good; you don't really have a good friend like the
other kids .
You try to cheer yourself up . What's on TV tonight? It doesn't
work . Your favorite program was yesterday , Monday evening. Mon­
day ? That means today isn't Wednesday ! You got the day wrong. You

feel silly , but also relieved, happy even . You run back into the school
and ask the janitor if you can call your mom .
How did you feel as you read through the scene and imagined
yourself as that child ? What went through your mind ?
You may have noticed, imagining yourself as the child, that your
feelings depended first on what you were thinking and imagining about
what had happened to your dad at each stage, and second on what that
brought to mind about things generally in your life. In this scenario it's
easy to see how some thoughts, activated by one event, bring to mind
other thoughts and feelings. For example, feeling lonely because he has
been left by his dad leads the child to thoughts of not having as many
close friends as others-for many of us, this is a feeling that persists
into adulthood.
The turning point of the story occurs when the child realizes that
he has mixed up the days. This new piece of information, that it isn't
Wednesday, completely changes how the child sees the situation.
Changes in emotion follow the change in perspective.
Although this is only a story, we can all recall situations in which
we have misinterpreted things, j ust as the child in the story did. It is of­
ten only on these sorts of occasions that we see how much our emo­
tions depend on our interpretation

of situations. Most of the time we
don't get such a reality check.
There is nothing particularly
mysterious in the way the mind is
working here. The mind creates a
narrative, a story to fit the facts as

we see them. And once created, the story may be very difficult to dis­
mantle. Yet that story can have alarmingly powerful effects on our
emotions and feelings. It can press our emotional buttons, even if it is a
complete or partial fiction with little basis in reality. All the feelings
experienced by the child-the worry about his father, his sense of
abandonment, his feeling of loneliness-were brought about by an
event that never actually happened. The child only thought his dad was
failing to tum up at the promised time.

A century ago, Sigmund Freud popularized the idea that we all
have an unconscious that lies deep below the surface of our awareness,
motivating our actions in ways that are highly complex and that take
considerable time to unearth and understand. Those in mainstream ac­
ademic psychology rej ected such ideas as unprovable and focused in­
stead on observable behavior ( in a movement known as "behavior­
ism" ) . So fierce was this reaction against Freud that it was only in the
late 1 960s and the 1 970s that behaviorally oriented psychotherapists
started to take seriously the interior world of their patients: the subj ec­
tive domain of thoughts, memories, ideas, predictions, and plans. And
they made a remarkable discovery: most of what drives our emotions
and behavior is not deeply unconscious, but j ust below the surface of
our awareness. Not only that, but this rich interior world, with its mo­
tivations, expectations, interpretations, and story lines, is accessible to
all of us if we dare to look. We can all become more aware of the
"stream of consciousness" going on in our minds, moment by moment.
It often takes the form of a running commentary. If it is potentially
damaging to us, it is not because it is buried deep in the psyche but
because it is virtually unattended. We have gotten so used to its
whisperings that we don't even notice it is here. And so, it shapes our
lives.
Once we have reacted to a particular situation, we rarely go back
to check on whether our interpretation was actually accurate. Of
course, it is entirely possible that a father might have really forgotten
to pick up his child. It does happen. But most often our minds do not
consider a range of options; our first impressions, reactive as they are,
are usually taken as an accurate readout on reality-the way it really is.
The example of the waiting school child and of the scenario in
Chapter 1 in which you were asked to imagine a friend failing to ac­
knowledge you from across the street show how even small differences
in our mood and thinking can determine our whole perspective on an
event. These little shifts in mood and thought end up entangling the
mind, creating more feelings and downward mood spirals as the
thinking mind ruminates on and on to find answers that don't come.
And so we create a story-a "drama about me"-that may gradually
wander far away from the here and now and far away from the way

1 64

things actually are. Once the
script we have concocted for

ments-without ever checking
back with the here and now. Without knowing it, our thoughts become
words carved in stone rather than words written on water.

S EEING THOUGHTS AS THOUGHTS
As we saw in Chapters 1 and 2 , our thoughts influence our feelings and
body sensations and are themselves influenced by our feelings and body
sensations. But that does not make our thoughts true, no matter how
compelling they may feel.
As we have seen, in mindfulness-based programs one very effec­
tive strategy for regaining mental balance is to attend to the direct ex­
perience of feelings in the body. As far as thoughts themselves are con­
cerned, through mindfulness we can cultivate a new and very different

relationship to them, allowing thoughts simply to be here instead of ana­
lyzing them, trying to work out where they came from, or trying to get
rid of them in any way. In awareness, we see them immediately for
what they actually are: constructions, mysterious creations of the mind,
mental events that may or may not accurately reflect reality. We come
to realize that our thoughts are not facts. Nor are they really "mine" or
" me. "
When cultivating mindfulness, we adopt this orientation because

clearly the link between thoughts and feelings. But our task is not only
to become more aware of our thoughts, but to become aware of them in
a

different way, to relate to them from within the being mode of mind.

In being mode, it becomes much clearer which thoughts are helpful
and which are merely the endless "propaganda" of depression.
If you have been practicing the meditations described up to this
point, chances are that your relationship with your thoughts has al­
ready begun to shift. Maybe you occasionally find yourself responding
differently (perhaps even smiling) when you catch yourself j umping to
the "usual" doom-and-gloom conclusions or assumptions: "She's trying
to undermine me and make me look foolish," "I'll never get this j ob
done," "I always say the dumbest things." Maybe you don't start to
brood as quickly following such thoughts. Or like Meg in Chapter 7 ,
perhaps you can think o f something that used to trigger immediate up­
set without getting charged up by it-now you can j ust let the thought,
with all its potential baggage, float by.
Such changes may reflect the fact that, perhaps without realizing
it, we have already begun to learn how to respond more skillfully to our
thoughts during meditation. The act of registering in awareness that
the mind is wandering involves a shift from being totally absorbed in
our thought stream to being detached enough from it to see what has
happened. And each time we gently label our thoughts as "thinking"
and intentionally disengage from the thought stream, we reinforce the
shift in relationship toward seeing thoughts as thoughts. They are men­
tal events that pass through the mind like clouds or weather patterns
pass through the sky.

Hearing Our Thoughts
A thought arises, lingers in consciousness for a relatively short
while , then fades. It's j ust a mental event, an "obj ect" that we can pay
attention to but that is neither "me" nor reality. But sometimes we may
need a more concrete way to shift our perspective so as to perceive it in
that way. Our sense of hearing may provide such a way.
Sounds are around us all the time. We don't need to go out and

166

TRAN SFORM ING UNHAPPINESS

hunt them down. We can j ust give ourselves over to hearing what is al- .
ready here to be heard in this very moment. Sounds are j ust part of the
input the mind receives from the world.
These facts determine how we normally relate to sounds. When
we hear the sound of a truck in the street, we don't automatically think
of it as part of ourselves; we know it is in the street outside.
If we think of the mind as the "ear" for our thoughts, then perhaps
we can learn to relate to thoughts that arise in the mind in the same
way that we relate to sounds arriving at the ears. Normally we may not
even be aware of the extent to which the mind is "receiving" thoughts
until we refine our ability to be aware of

ing them the space to simply be here as

of awareness. By analogy, mindfulness of hearing can help us develop a
similar sense of openness toward our thoughts, allowing them simply to
come and go, without enticing us into the drama they are creating.
In the following exercise, we practice attending to sounds and hear­
ing ( mindfulness of hearing) for a time and then move to seeing if we are
able to relate to thoughts and thinking in the same way. In this way, we
are creating optimal conditions to "freeze the frame" on that way of at­
tending to experience while we shift the focus of our attention from
sounds to thoughts. The instructions for this practice of mindfulness of
hearing and thinking follow and are also on the practice CD (Track 6 ) .

Carried Away by the Thought Stream
Just as the mind will wander during other meditation practices, from
time to time most of us will find that our mind has been drawn into a
particular thought stream and carried away during the preceding exer­
cise. Returning to the movie metaphor, it's as if the mind has left its
seat and gotten sucked into the action up there on the screen, now
playing a part in the story that it was mindfully observing the moment
before. When you realize that this is happening, all you need to do is
acknowledge that the mind had been caught up in the thought stream
and that now awareness has been reestablished. It is helpful to notice
any emotional reaction or intensity directed at any element of the
story line and then, gently and compassionately, to escort the mind
back to its seat, back to observing the play of thoughts and feelings. If
at any time you feel your mind has become unfocused and scattered, or
if it repeatedly gets drawn into the drama of your thinking and imagin­
ing, it is always possible to come back to the sensations of the breath in
the body, using the breath as

as mental events and becoming seduced by their content and emo­

them, drawn imperceptibly into believing that they are true and they
are us and we are them. Once we "become" them, we can slide down
the well-greased grooves of the doing mode and fall back all too easily
into ruminative brooding. This new relationship to thoughts may not
be too difficult to hold for brief periods of time. But, in the earlier
stages of practice, the longer we attend to our thoughts, the more likely
we will be drawn into them and mesmerized so that we lose our mind­
ful perspective on them.
Meditation teacher Joseph Goldstein puts it neatly:
When we lose ourselves in thought, identification is strong. Thought
sweeps our mind and carries it away, and, in a very short time, we can be
carried far indeed. We hop a train of association, not knowing that we
have hopped on, and certainly not knowing the destination. Somewhere
down the line, we may wake up and realize that we have been thinking,
that we have been taken for a ride . And when we step down from the
train, it may be in a very d ifferent mental environment from where we
j umped aboard.

If we find ourselves taken hostage and carried away by the thought
stream, it makes sense to steady and gather the mind ( Chapter 4) by fo­
cusing on the breath and remembering that every in-breath is a new
beginning and every out-breath a release, a new letting go.

NOTICING S ELF-CRITICAL COMMENTARY

Although we may practice with thoughts as our primary focus of atten­
tion for only five minutes at a time, there are innumerable other oppor­
tunities to apply and extend this new perspective. The more we engage
in the various formal meditation practices, the more we may notice
ourselves having reactions to what we are experiencing, judging how
well things are going, and criticizing ourselves if we think we're not

1 70

TRAN SFORM ING UNHAPPINESS

feeling what we are "supposed to be" feeling or that we are "not very
good" at meditating. Such occasions are wonderful opportunities to re­
member that j udging and criticizing are really j ust more thinking. Can
we, at such times, relate to these patterns of thinking as mental events ?
It can help to recall how we relate to the less-charged thoughts and im­
ages during the formal practice of mindfulness of thoughts. Practicing
in this way allows us to bring this relationship to thoughts into more
and more of our moments, freeing ourselves from their grip and allow­
ing our inherent wisdom to discern their wider movements and pat­
terns within the mind. With time, we may come to experience an
open, spacious quality in our awareness that easily holds whatever is
arising in the domain of mind or body ( including any j udgmental
thoughts ) and learn to rest in that awareness itself.
Jacob found that his daily meditation practice was frequently ac­
companied by a running critical commentary: You've lost it again . Can't
you even stay focused on your breath for half a minute at a time? This is a
waste of time . You're messing this up just like everything else you try . Can't
you get anything right? What's wrong with you? What a failure you are! At
first Jacob found this commentary an upsetting, albeit familiar, "inter­
ference" obstructing and undermining his attempts to get on with "the
proper business" of meditation, which he saw as keeping his attention
firmly focused on the breath . This is a common experience. Gradually
we may come to realize that awareness of these patterns of thought as
thoughts is meditation. How can we help ourselves to see this ?

Giving Negative Thought Patterns a Name
One possibility is to give a name to the patterns of thinking that ha­
bitually occur. We can use labels such as "Judging Mind" or "Hope­
less Mind" or identify them as subpersonalities: "My worst critic,"
"Doubting Thomas," and so on. The important thing is that we have a
way of pointing to the common threads and general themes that cut
across a range of specific contents in our minds. Ideally, the labels that
we choose should help us drop into a wider and wiser perspective on
these thought patterns. Such labels may help us see them, with some

Seeing Thoughts

1 71

degree of nonattachment, as frequent visitors to the mind rather than
identifying with them as parts of ourselves or hearing them as the voice
of truth or reality.
Jacob found that he could label the whole critical, judgmental
package as "Critical Mind." Once he had done that, he was able to
look out for the visits of Critical Mind and greet it as an old, if not
wholly welcome, acquaintance. This enabled Jacob to let Critical
Mind come and go, without giving it the power to trigger the cascade
of negative thoughts that would normally have quickly mired him in
the negativity with which he was already so familiar.

Negative Thoughts in the Landscape of Depression
Identifying negative j udgmental thoughts as recurring mental patterns
can be of enormous help in allowing us to relate to them more obj ec­
tively and less personally. Those of us who have experienced depres­
sion in the past can take this process a step further if we can see nega­
tive thoughts for what they often are: well-known features of the
landscape of depression. They are not reliable readouts on truth or real­
ity.

Are any of these thoughts familiar to you, from your own experi­
ence ? If you've experienced periods of depression in the past, seeing
this list may take you back, not wholly willingly, to the thoughts that
dominated your mind at those times. Even if you haven't experienced
prolonged bouts of depression, you may recall having thoughts similar
to these when feeling "down."
Jade, when asked during our program whether any of the thoughts

Seeing Thoughts

1 73

on the list were familiar, said, "Yes-all of them." For her this exercise
revealed a crucial distinction: "When I was in the middle of the depres­
sion, I believed the thoughts 1 20 percent-this was how things were,
no question-I was j ust 'seeing the truth,' grim though that seemed.
But now-now that I'm feeling okay most of the time-I don't often
have these thoughts, and if I do they j ust seem to be faint echoes of
how they were then. Looking back, I j ust wonder how I could
ever have believed all that stuff. I ' ll never make it-yes, that's j ust how
it seemed, there was absolutely no hope of getting through the
depression-and yet here I am I-living proof that I did "
This simple exercise has some profound implications. When we
are depressed and experience these thoughts, they don't feel like just
thoughts. They seem to be telling the truth about us, our self-worth,
and the state of our lives. But almost everyone who experiences depres­
sion has very similar thoughts. That suggests a very different possibil­
ity: these thoughts are part of the territory, the landscape, of depres­
sion. They are symptoms of depression in j ust the same way as aches
and pains are symptoms of the flu. They come and go as part of what
we call depression. Viewed in this way, these thoughts are informative ,
but not in the way we might have imagined. They tell us a great deal
about the thinking patterns that go along with depression, about the
way a low mood can affect our thought processes. They tell us very lit­
tle about the real state of ourselves or the world or the future .
This alternative way of viewing such negative thoughts comes
across particularly powerfully when people go through a mindfulness­
based cognitive therapy program with others who, like them, have
experienced multiple episodes of
depression but are now relatively
well.

similar to the question about
their familiarity with the automatic thoughts, something remarkable
happens. A moment of realization that "This is depression-it's not

as "normal" people-friendly, supportive, funny. Every last one of them

TRAN SFORM I N G UNHAPPINESS

has at some point, in the depths of despair, harbored the private con­
viction that "It's me-only me-who is no good. " Now they realize
that other people have the same negative automatic thoughts while
depressed-and believe them with every fiber of their being. Suddenly
they don't feel quite so alone. More than that, they begin to see how

now, perhaps only a few weeks

later, we look back and wonder, incredulously, How could I ever have

thought that?
If we can adopt the perspective of allowing thoughts to be seen
and known and recognized in awareness for what they are, in this mo­
ment, our relationship to them will be altered in the next moment. In
that way, we can free ourselves from their entangling, distorting, harm­
ing potential.
Jade had always assumed that only by analyzing her thoughts
( "spiraling off into analyzing," she called it) could she reduce their de­
structive effects. Then, during one practice period, she suddenly real­
ized, "All this analysis that I try to do-it isn't making it less scary,
thinking about it like that. It's making it more scary ! "
Through mindfulness meditation practice, J ade was catching a
glimpse of the possibility of the freedom that comes when we are able
to let go of identifying with our thoughts, the freedom that comes from
resting in awareness, watching thoughts come and go like clouds (or
even storms ) in the mind. She caught a glimmering of the power of not
taking things so personally when, in actuality, they were impersonal
events and hardly reliable carriers of absolute truth. With this insight
Jade found she was released from having to analyze everything. She saw
that thinking things through too easily got her lost in an endless laby­
rinth of memories and worries.

"Actually, simply staying with

than analyzing it."

BEFRIENDING THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS

It's incredibly valuable to recognize automatic negative thoughts,
among other thinking patterns. Tuning in to them and seeing them for
what they are gives us another opportunity to disrupt the depression
cycle-to break the chain from a different angle. Still, these thoughts
are usually j ust the tip of the iceberg. The tip can be valuable in alert­
ing us to the larger mass below. But if we wish to reduce the threat from
the iceberg as a whole, it may not be particularly effective to focus ex­
clusively on the tip. If we dynamite the tip away, a new section of ice­
berg will simply rise above the surface, and if we wish to navigate safely
around the iceberg, we would do well to assess the scale of the sub­
merged portion rather than adj ust our steering to avoid only what we
can see.
Although our thoughts obviously affect our feelings, the thoughts
themselves originate in underlying, less perceptible feelings: the base of
the iceberg. Those feelings may persist j ust on the edge of awareness
long after the individual negative thoughts "born" of them have arisen,
passed through the mind, and disappeared. So it's usually helpful, once
we acknowledge the presence of thoughts as mental events, to go un­
derneath the thought level and work through directly sensed body
experience-the feelings we get from an unpleasant experience { such
as a sense of anger} as well as physical sensations {such as tightening in
the shoulders} . To do this, we bring an affectionate and discerning
awareness to each aspect of our felt emotions, as best we can, using the
meditation practices from Chapter 7 . We may notice changes from mo-

TRANSFORMING UNHAPPINESS

1 76

ment to moment-for example, the transformation of a sense of anger
to a sense of hurt, then to a softer sense of sadness. We will revisit
working in this way in Chapters 9 and Chapter 1 0 .

The key to awa kening from the bonds of fea r is to move from our menta l
stories into i m med iate contact with the sensations of fea r-sq ueezi ng,
pressing, burning, trembling . . . . In fact, the story-as long as we re­
main awa ke and don't get stuck in it-can become a usefu l gateway to
the raw fea r itself. While the mind wi l l conti nue to generate thoug hts
a bout what we fea r, we ca n recog nize the thoug hts for what they a re and
d rop under them again and again to connect with the feel i ngs i n our
body.
-Ta ra Brach, Radical Acceptance

The exploration of the ecology of our thoughts and feelings is par­
ticularly difficult when our thoughts are about a painful past event or
about current unfinished business that seems to call for immediate ac­
tion. Then the thoughts seem to have real power over us. An effective
response is not to ignore them but to see them clearly, with awareness.
When we let them come and go, we remain free to choose which
thoughts are appropriate, even wise and healthy; which to listen to, be­
lieve, and possibly act on; and
which to simply recognize as un­
helpful and let pass.
In doing this work, we are

presence of unpleasant thoughts
and feelings. It is tempting at such times to instantly switch our atten­
tion away as soon as we detect that the thoughts or feelings are un­
pleasant and to return our focus of attention back to the haven of the
breath. But it is more skillful to pause long enough to bring to them a
spirit of gentle inquiry and curiosity, an investigative awareness: Ah ,

Seeing Thoughts

177

there you are ; let me see who you are . In this way, we not only develop a
new perspective toward them, seeing them, increasingly, as passing
events in the mind. We are also in much better shape to become famil­
iar with the content of recurring messages. Furthermore, this sense of
openness, curiosity, and exploration will activate the approach mode of
the mind and brain. In itself, this will directly counteract the avoid­
ance mode and so provide a further steadying influence that can pre­
vent us from getting caught up in and carried away in all our own imag­
inings.
Identifying and naming our recurrent thought patterns is one way
to help us see the "tapes in the mind" for what they are. Recognizing
them when they are starting up allows us to say: "Ah, I know this tape;
this is my 'I'm a total failure' tape or my 'I'll never be happy' tape." This
will not necessarily switch it off, or if it appears to, it will almost cer­
tainly return soon. The difference will be in the way we relate to it: as a
fact that we can do little about, or as a highly conditioned and inaccu­
rate "tape" running in the mind that will continue to be an inconve­
nience until the "batteries" run down and it ceases of its own accord.
Amazingly, in the domain of the mind, this cessation can come
about naturally, without any forcing or struggling, when we are able to
see, to grasp, to understand what is going on with clarity and self­
acceptance. In the understanding is the release and the cessation. This
is the cardinal characteristic of awareness and clear seeing. It is embod­
ied and inhabited through the gift of mindfulness practice, a gift we
can give to ourselves over and over again. Yes, it involves a good deal
of discipline, but that discipline itself, the willingness to look and actu­
ally to see, is in fact a truly valuable gift we can give ourselves.

B EYOND THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS :
CHOICELESS AWARENESS

Up to this point, we have described the practices of mindfulness medi­
tation as they are taught sequentially in the mindfulness program, one
after another: mindfulness of taste; mindfulness of the movements of

1 78

TRAN S FO R M I N G U N H A P P I N E S S

the breath; mindfulness of body sensations lying down, as we stretch,
move, and walk; mindfulness of pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral feel­
ings; mindfulness of aversion; mindfulness of sounds; and finally mind­
fulness of thoughts and emotions. Each of these practices directs us re­
peatedly to focus our attention in a specific way on a particular aspect
of our experience. In this way, we are progressively cultivating our ca­
pacity to be mindful, to develop the skills that can free us from unhap­
piness and depression.
All the various practices that we have visited so far cultivate
awareness in relation to particular obj ects of attention. All of them il­
luminate different aspects of our lives and of our interior landscapes.
But these divisions are somewhat arbitrary; the awareness we have
been cultivating is the same whether it remains focused on the breath,
on tasting, on bodily sensations, or on feelings or thoughts.
The next practice unifies all these separate strands of training in
mindfulness and reveals them to actually be elements of one seamless
whole. This is the practice of choiceless awareness. This is the final ex­
tended formal practice we will introduce. In the next chapter, we con­
sider how our developing mindfulness skills might be carried from for­
mal and protected settings to the more challenging informal practice
settings of everyday life. This is where our need for them is most urgent
and where they can be most useful.
To begin cultivating choiceless awareness in formal practice, we
can include a few minutes of it at the end of any of the other practices
we are engaged in, as is the case toward the end of Track 6 ( mindful­
ness of sounds and thoughts ) on the CD. It's always possible to j ump to
choiceless awareness at any moment, simply by letting go of any and all
obj ects of attention. This sounds easy, but it is in fact a very challeng­
ing practice because we have nothing specific to focus on. We rest in
awareness itself, without any attempt to direct our attention toward
anything other than awareness itself. There is no need even to think
that you are meditating or that there is even a "you" to meditate. Even
these are seen and known as thoughts by awareness, and in the seeing,
in the knowing, they are seen to dissipate, again, like touching soap
bubbles.

Seeing Thoughts

179

Choice less Awa reness
I n the early stages of this practice, it might be wise just to play with it for
relatively short periods of ti me, returning to the breath or featu ring some
other specific chosen object of attention at other times. It sounds so sim­
ple to "just sit" without a ny chosen object to attend to-to simply be
awa reness itself, to be the knowing. It is not so easy. Yet with time and
motivation, the practice of choiceless awareness can become more and
more robust and more and more com pe l l i n g .
We beg in with a few m i n utes o f focusing on t h e breath, and then, if
we ca re to, we a l l ow the field of awareness to expa nd to include a ny or
all of the fol l owing : body sensations (including the breath), sounds,
thoug hts, and feelings.
Then, whenever we feel ready to, we see if it is possible to let go of
a ny pa rticu lar object of attention, l i ke the breath, or class of objects of at­
tention, l i ke sou nds or thoug hts, and let the field of awareness be open to
whatever a rises in the la ndscape of the mind and the body and the worl d .
We sim ply rest in awareness itself, effortlessly a pprehending whatever
a rises from moment to moment. That might include the breath, sensa­
tions from the body, sounds, thoug hts, or feelings. As best we can, we
just sit, completely awa ke, not holding on to a nything, not looking for
a nything, having no agenda whatsoever other tha n em bodied wakefu l­
ness.
This practice invites us to be com pletely open and receptive to what­
ever comes into the field of awa reness, l i ke an em pty mi rror; simply re­
flecti ng whatever comes before it, expecti ng nothing and clinging to
nothi ng; awareness itself attending to the entire field of present-moment
experience in utter sti l l ness.

As we engage in this practice, we may become increasingly aware
of the distinction between the obj ects to which we can direct our at­
tention, if we choose, and the space of awareness in which all our expe­
riences arise. The obj ects could be thought of as celestial bodies hang­
ing in space. In choiceless awareness, we become the space that holds
whatever condenses momentarily within it. Awareness, like space, is
boundless, having no edges or limits. The invitation is to settle into
this awareness, to be the knowing, the nonconceptual knowing that

1 80

TRAN SFORMING UNHAPPIN ESS

pure awareness actually is. Awareness is not itself subj ect to pain, al­
though it bears profound and empathic witness to pain. And so once
we have become acquainted with it, we may find it easier simply to
hold even the most difficult and painful of our experiences within it.
We may even make the curious, but profound, discovery that aware­
ness is already free, intrinsically whole, and deeply knowing.

mindfulness in our lives sooner or later discover that it is most difficult to
be mindful at j ust those times when mindfulness would be most helpful.
When the pressure is on, when we're feeling bad, when there doesn't
seem to be a moment to spare, these are the times when being mindful
can be a maj or challenge. They are also the times when we need it most.
Mindfulness is at least as much about ordinary daily living as it is
about making some quiet time for formal practice. In fact, we could say
that ultimately life itself is the practice; there is no waking moment in
which we might not be more alive and more in touch if we were more
aware. So the real work of mindfulness actually starts with life itself,
with all its twists and turns, in all its guises and disguises. This is espe­
cially so when life is particularly difficult, when it is hard going, when
the mind is all over the place. At such times we most need the stability,
the clarity, and the insight that mindfulness offers. In this chapter, we
gather together the threads of all we've learned so far to see how we
can weave our discoveries into the fabric of our daily lives.
From the outset, both the mindfulness-based stress reduction

18 1

1 82

TRAN SFORM ING UNHAPPINESS

(MBSR) program and the mindfulness-based cognitive therapy
(MBCT) program emphasize the importance of bringing mindfulness
to everyday life. They invite us to pay attention to routine activities
such as brushing our teeth, feeding the cat, and taking out the garbage
(Chapter 3 ) ; to walk mindfully when we are walking (Chapter 4 ) ; to
use sensations in our bodies as a way to stay aware and present in each
moment ( Chapter 6 ) ; and to support mindfulness of any experience by
"breathing with" it (Chapter 6 ) . The MBCT program also offers a spe­
cial tool that is specifically designed to bring mindfulness into our ev­
eryday lives, particularly at the tipping points when our mood is beginning to go down. The tool is a mini-meditation called the three­

three steps. Many of those who have participated in the program have
singled this practice out as the most useful feature of the whole course.
When so many of our daily tasks seem to require doing mode's critical
thinking, this practice offers a quick and surprisingly effective way to
switch to the being mode when we most need to do so.
One way to experiment with this would be to start by reading the
following instructions all the way through, then diving in and taking a
three-minute breathing space right now. Alternatively, you could fol­
low the instructions on the CD (Track 7 ) . You may find it helpful to
spend about a minute on each of the three steps, or you might want to
vary the times (for example, by spending somewhat longer on Step 2 ) .
At first we practice this breathing space for three minutes at set
times, three times a day, in a rather formal way. But once we have the
hang of it, it can be deployed anytime, anywhere, for the duration of
one or two breaths, to five-ten minutes, as conditions permit. Soon we
may find we are using it, to some degree or another, in many situations,
such as when we notice unpleasant feelings or a sense of "tightening"

Mindfu lness in Everyday Life

1 83

or "holding" in the body or feelings of being overwhelmed by events. In
such situations, when low mood threatens to overwhelm us, the
breathing space allows us to steady ourselves. It allows us to see clearly
what is happening through direct, experiential knowing. It provides a
place from which we can choose mindfully what next steps are required
by the situation we find ourselves in.

If you become aware of a ny sensations of d iscomfort, tension, or
resista nce, zero i n on them by breath ing i nto them on each in­
breath and b reath ing out from them on each out-breath as you
soften and open. If you want to, you might say to you rself on the out­
breath,
"It's okay . . . whatever it is, it's already here: let me feel it. "

As best you can, bring this expa nded awareness into the next mo­
ments of you r day.

In the first step of the breathing space, we are asked to come fully
into the present moment and step out of automatic pilot, out of doing
mode. We intentionally suspend our usual habits of self-critical j udg­
ment; we let go of trying to get somewhere other than where we al­
ready are. We practice restraining our usual tendency to fix what the
doing mind thinks needs fixing. We simply acknowledge and bring
awareness to what is already here in this moment, as it is.
Sustaining this open stance of acknowledging and attending can
be very difficult. Old habits of thinking have well-worn grooves that
can easily carry us away. So we take the second step, of gathering and
focusing our mind on a single obj ect: the sensations of breathing, j ust
this breath coming in, j ust this breath going out. In this way, we give
ourselves a chance to steady the mind and to remain right here, right
now.
Having gathered ourselves in this way, we take the third step. We
expand the field of awareness to include the whole body. We enter the
spaciousness of the being mode and, as best we can, allow that wider
domain of being to be with us when we return to what we were doing.
These three steps help us shift seamlessly from the mode of doing to
the mode of being.
For most of us, bringing mindfulness into the busyness of everyday
life may turn out to present a big challenge. The breathing space was
developed to allow a deliberate change of stance toward what is going on,
in any moment. In a potentially difficult situation, this shift in mode

may be essential for an effective and appropriate response. For this rea­
son, the three-minute breathing space is more structured and directive
than many of the other practices described so far. In particular, we start
with a definite change in posture, and we remind ourselves that there
are three different stages to the practice (for example, by using the
phrases "Step 1 ," "Step 2," and "Step 3 " ) . The use of such an explicitly
structured approach to the instructions is not accidental. The shorter a
practice, the more likely the tendency for it to become merely a brief
time-out, snatched in the midst of an ongoing crisis, rather than a ma­
jor shift in our mode of mind-from doing to being.
It might help to think of the path that your attention travels in
the breathing space as having the shape of an hourglass. An hourglass
has a wide opening, a narrow neck, and a wide base. This image can
remind us to open to experience as it is in Step 1 , to gather attention

2, and to open to a sense of

breathing space as traveling a path
with the shape of an hourglass.

The breathing space needs
to have the qualities of a sharp

and discerning sword; used with compassion, it can cut through the do­
ing mode to provide us with a powerful and healing alternative. The
practice can open up new freedom and choice about how best to re­
spond to what is happening in our lives, inwardly and outwardly while
it is happening.
The breathing space forges an explicit link between the formal
practices described in the preceding chapters and daily life. Like an
embroidery needle, it picks up the threads of the learning that natu­
rally unfolds during regular formal practice and weaves them into the
fabric of everyday life. The breathing space's Step 2, "Gathering," is like
a concentrated version of Mindfulness of the Breath (Chapter 4 ) . Step
3 , "Expanding," resonates with the formal practices of widening the
attention around the breath to include a sense of the body as a whole
(Chapter 6) and embracing a difficulty (Chapter 7 ) . The significance
of Step 1 may be less apparent, so let's look at this aspect more closely.

1 86

AWARENESS AND ACKNO WLEDGMENT

Becoming aware is the first move in taking a purposeful breathing
space. The aim of this step is to use the power of mindfulness
•

To disentangle ourselves from the doing, ruminative mode

•

To drop into a feeling/sensing/knowing/being mode

•

To acknowledge or witness our thoughts, feelings, and body sen­
sations as we rest in awareness of them.

Perhaps because the practice is called the "breathing space," the
tendency is to go straight to the breath. But the first instruction does
not even mention the breath. Instead, we are invited to become aware
of our posture and intentionally allow it to express a sense of dignity, of
taking a stand in our life, in our own body, to whatever degree may be
possible in this moment. In this way we are "tuning the instrument" for
stepping out of automatic pilot mode and acknowledging whatever is
going on right now. This stepping out of autopilot and into awareness
is inextricably linked.
The instructions for Step 1 next invite us to focus our attention
inward and to acknowledge our experience of thoughts, feelings, and
body sensations, in tum, in that very moment. We start with thoughts
because, most often, that is where our minds are likely to be focused as
we begin the breathing space. We focus on body sensations last as this
then provides a natural transition to focusing on the body sensations of
breathing in Step 2. It may come as a surprise to know that this very
act of parsing or sorting of experience into these three aspects­
thoughts, feelings, and body sensations-is, in and of itself, of great im­
portance. Although we may initially perceive an unpleasant experi­
ence as an undifferentiated "bad thing," a big black blob that we j ust
want to be rid of, if we attend to it more closely, we will generally find
that it can be recognized as an interlinked pattern of thoughts, feelings,
and body sensations. Becoming aware of the separate components of
the pattern in this way can be invaluable in and of itself-the mind
will respond differently, in new and potentially more creative ways, to

the perception of a complex mosaic of distinct experiences than it will
to the perception of a uniform hated thing.

this experientially. Suddenly he was
able to relate to unpleasant experiences as simply bundles of thoughts,
feelings, and body sensations. Identifying less personally with his re­
sponse to unpleasant events, he found the whole situation became
lighter, more spacious, freer. The first step of the three-minute breath­
ing space provides a way to bring the same shift in perspective, to one
degree or another, to any aspect of our experience.
The first step of the breathing space also provides an opportunity
to fully acknowledge our experience in the moment, as Matthew dis­
covered:
"I was once on a work trip, and my wife had come with me. The
evening before the meeting, I was ironing some clothes, and my wife
was reading on the other side of the room, behind me. I was tired and
feeling a little anxious about how the next day would go. Was I sufficiently prepared ?
"I found some resentment creeping into my mind. Here I was,
ironing, when I could be preparing more for tomorrow, if my wife
would only help me out a bit. There she was, j ust reading. I recognized
this as a not-very-helpful thought stream-I think of myself as a 'mod­
ern man' who takes care of his own needs. I told myself that my wife
had every right to be enj oying her holiday, and so it was appropriate for

TRANSFORMING UNHAPPINESS

1 88

me to take responsibility for my own clothes. But somehow, a part of
me did not seem satisfied with this. Soon another thought appeared.

But this is a very important meeting-and this is one occasion when I should
not have to be ironing when I could be preparing. Why can't she see my pre­
dicament and offer to help me? The resentment and irritation were rap­
idly mounting.
"The Vietnamese meditation teacher Thich Nhat Hanh talks
about doing activities j ust to do them-for example, doing the dishes
j ust to do the dishes { and not j ust to get them finished to rush on to the
next activity } . Here was a perfect opportunity to practice his teaching.
Right. Focus on the ironing . . . the texture of the cloth, the smell of
hot steam, the movement of the iron. Then the next thought arose:

No! I should not have to be using my mindfulness practice to cope with this
ironing. I should not have to be doing the ironing at all. I tried to focus
again, gritting my mental teeth. Focus on ironing, the smell of the steam ,
the feel of the cloth! No use. The thoughts came streaming back.
"It was at that moment that I remembered the breathing space.
The first step was not focusing but acknowledging. I became aware that
I was trying to use meditation to change things; I had not acknowl­
edged the situation in its entirety ! Here was the ironing, here was the
resentment, here were the thoughts. Acknowledging meant allowing
all of it to be present as it was and, as the breathing space unfolded, to
be able to say inwardly to myself: It's okay : whatever it is , it's already

here . For me, this meant giving up the struggle to be 'good, ' to be politi­
cally correct and to acknowledge that, at that moment, I felt really
resentful-and to say It's okay to feel this way. Of course this felt danger­
ous, as if it would allow my resentment to get out of hand.
"In fact, amazingly, it dropped away. Why ? Because for the first
time in that little scene, I guess I had acknowledged the whole thing: I
had seen what was really happening, rather than obsessing about what
I thought should be happening."
"As it turned out, I need not have been too concerned about pre­
paring for the meeting. During that night, some people came into our
hotel room as we slept and stole most of our possessions, including our
computers, diaries, credit cards, and money. At the meeting the follow-

ing day, somehow ironing or how prepared I was did not seem that im­
portant."
Matthew reported later that he had originally thought he was ac­
knowledging what was going on and taking action. But then, he said,
he realized that his acknowledgment was only partial. He recognized
that he was attempting to use the practice to escape or fix or dispel his
bad mood. The change in his mood came about only when he was first
able and willing to hold all aspects of what was going on in awareness,
including his resentment, with full acknowledgment. As we saw in
Chapter 7, the shift from rej ecting a situation or condition to accept­
ing it as it is, because it is already as it is, is essential to responding skill­
fully to a difficult or unpleasant situation. Often, wholehearted ac­
knowledgment of what is already

The second and third steps allow that shift in perspective to be consol­

US ING THE BREATHING S PACE

We need to be cautious of a potential pitfall in the way we use the
breathing space. It is easy to see it as merely a time-out, a brief moment
when we can retreat and relax before advancing again into the busy­
ness of our lives. Although it may have some short-term benefits along
these lines, the time-out approach is not as helpful in the long run as
the shift from doing to being mode because it does not alter our feel­
ings of being under stress and pressure. It is best to see the breathing
space as an opportunity to bring awareness to whatever is going on at
. this moment, to notice and step out of the routine we have become

1 90

TRAN SFORMING UNHAPPINESS

caught up in, so that we might relate differently to whatever difficulty
we could be facing.
What is the difference between taking a break and taking a
breathing space ? An analogy may help. Most of us have at some time
been caught in a severe downpour and have had to run for shelter, per­
haps in a shop doorway. Sometimes we are simply glad to be out of the
rain. We stand for a while, hoping it will stop. We are dry at the mo­
ment, but as the rain continues we know that sooner or later we are go­
ing to have to face it; the thing we tried to escape is still here. Finally,
in one scenario, we go back out into the rain, grumbling, even cursing
our luck as the rain drenches us.
At other times, another scenario might unfold for us. We may take
shelter in a very different way. We stand in a doorway for a while,
aware of the prospect of getting soaked and not liking it much. We no­
tice that we are hoping that it will stop but, seeing that it shows no sign
of stopping, realize that being upset about it and worrying about how
soaked we are going to get is only adding to our discomfort. So we stop
clinging to the hope that it will stop raining and enter the downpour,
letting ourselves be drenched and accepting that this is what is hap­
pening at the moment. Approaching the situation in this way may allow us to experience the rain itself. We

may notice that there is something
rather compelling about the way it is

rain has not stopped. We may be get-

ting wetter and wetter. But our relationship to what is happening has
changed the whole experience.
The analogy of seeking shelter from a rainstorm evokes the mark­
edly different ways in which any meditative practice can be used: ei­
ther as a clever way of hiding from difficult experiences, hoping that
they will go away, or as a way of turning to face them, changing the
way we relate to them. The breathing space is more than a time-out, a
time when we take shelter, gritting our teeth and hoping the storm will
pass. By stepping out of automatic pilot, we allow ourselves to hold, as
obj ects of our attention, everything in the here and now. This includes

Mindfu lness in Everyday Life

1 91

our breath and body sensations and the j umble of our feelings and
thoughts. As we do this, we may find that our awareness of these feel­
ings or thoughts brings with it a fresh and transformative perspective.
Suddenly, we are inhabiting a wider view of our experience rather than
being so caught up in it. This was Elisa's experience of the breathing
space.
"I use it especially when there is pressure and things happening
and I want to get centered . . . Ah , there it is , my breath . . . and then I
step into it. A couple of times in the last week I 've had to do it inten­
tionally after going into a mood almost involuntarily-a negative reac­
tion, which is where my depression comes from usually, turning every­
thing so black, so bad. And so to refocus myself out of this, I j ust stop
for a second. I use it j ust to keep me right where I am-instead of react­
ing to the situation, to actually stay in it."
Elisa discovered that she does not have to react to her bad moods
by assuming they are telling the truth about what is going to happen:
"In the past when I've felt overwhelmed, thinking I ' ll never get

better; this is going to go on forever, I 've thought, That's how it is going to
be . . . it is all over now. Now it's different somehow . . . it means I can
actually realize, Well, hang on; it's not over yet. In some cases it hasn't
even started, so Let's just stick around and see what's actually going on­
doing this instead of letting my head determine that for me. "
It takes some practice for the three-minute breathing space to
serve as an effective, practical way to pause and gather ourselves in the
midst of troubling situations. That is why it is useful to begin by sched­
uling time for a breathing space at three specific times during the day,
for a week. That can get us launched into using it not only at prepro­
grammed times but also whenever we feel we most need it, such as
when we feel under particular stress.
The aim is for the three-minute breathing space to become an im­
portant vehicle for bringing the growing power of our formal medita­
tion practice into our daily life . Although we call it the three-minute
breathing space, it is important to see that the precise form and dura­
tion of the breathing space can be tailored to the constraints of any sit­
uation in which we find ourselves. If we can take ourselves to a quiet

1 92

TRAN SFORM ING UNHAPPINESS

place, such as the rest room, we can indulge in the luxury of a full
three-minute mini-meditation, with eyes closed if we find that helpful.
But if we are in the middle of an argument, stuck in a traffic j am,
trapped in a meeting, or shopping in a supermarket, we will need to ac­
commodate, flexibly and creatively, to the realities we encounter. We
might have to keep our eyes open, compress the sequence into less
than one minute, or gather our scattered attention on our footfalls as
we walk, rather than keep our focus on the breath. The most important
thing is that we have some understanding of what we are intending to
do; then we can experiment with as many ways of doing the breathing
space as our life demands. Just keeping in mind that a breathing space
is always available to us profoundly affects many aspects of our lives.
If the breathing space is practiced regularly, we may find that step­
ping out of automatic pilot, followed by intentionally implementing
the three steps, becomes a great ally in bringing mindfulness into every­
day life. It can help us deal skillfully with the difficult and distressing af­
fairs of life and also to become more appreciative of the many positive
features of our lives in all those moments that would otherwise pass us by.

Not Trying to Fix Things
Like all meditation practices, the three-minute breathing space re­
quires a kind of effort. But if we are too goal-oriented about it, our very
striving may only increase our difficulties, as Tara discovered. In her
case, it was because she perceived the breathing space as too short. "I
was conscious that it should j ust be three minutes," she explained, "so
it j ust feels like I have got to rush in there and think about-you
know-what I've got to think about, settling down, and then I am sort
of panicking that I am going to miss the three minutes. I can't relax."
The breathing space itself can actually become a source of aver­
sion if it is practiced in the spirit of fixing things. Tara realized this on
her own when she noticed that she was harboring an expectation that
she had to "do it right" if it was to "work" to calm her down. She de­
cided to take a different approach, saying to herself, Okay , remember,

there is no goal here . All I have to do is note inwardly what is going on-

Mindfulness in Everyday Life

1 93

thoughts , feelings , body sensations-bring my mind to the breath and the
belly , and then to a wider awareness including the body as a whole . If I do
that, that's fine . I've done what I have to do . The rest will take care of itself.
For Tara, as for any of us, our challenge and our responsibility in
this simple practice is simply to give ourselves over to it as best we can,
remembering that what matters is our orientation toward the present
moment--what we bring to it. What we get out of it is not under our
control. It is part of the adventure to observe compassionately, as best
we can, and see what comes of stopping and dropping in on ourselves
in this way in the midst of our daily lives. That is all. In this way, when
we are plagued with thoughts such as This is not working or I don't have

the time or I'm obviously not doing it right, we begin to see that these
thoughts are exactly what we need to become aware of and exactly what we
need to acknowledge . If we are motivated to undertake the challenge of
waking up to our lives, we only need to remember to take the time to
use the breathing space and then to give ourselves over to it, as best we
can in any given moment. One way of expressing this is to say that
each of us is responsible for the input . We do not need to worry about
the outcome , especially about whether it is "working. " The invitation is
to be patient and to persevere
in the practice and see what

worth trying to bring to it a
sense of allowing. She decided that she didn't have to "do it well" or
achieve any particular result. Just putting it into practice would be
enough. When she returned for the next session of the class, she was
intrigued by what had happened. "I noticed sensations," she said.
"Whether they were there all along and I didn't notice them or
whether they are new, I don't know. But I can certainly feel the physi­
cal sensations of anxiety like I haven't felt before. My suspicion is that
they were there all along."
At this stage in her account, it was not clear how things would

1 94

TRANSFORM ING UNHAPPINESS

tum out for Tara, but her experience did suggest that allowing the
physical sensations of anxiety to be held in awareness gave her oppor­
tunities to know them in new ways, and thereby to see new aspects of
them. She calls it their "ebb and flow."
"I think my body makes me aware of them," Tara said. "And then I
can focus on them and, you know, feel what's going on. I had never re­
ally paid attention to what is going on physically before. I 've certainly
been familiar with paying attention to the thoughts, but never the sen­
sations. That changes everything. It doesn't necessarily make things
worse or better, but there is an ebb and flow, an ongoing change in tex­
ture and feeling."
The breathing space reminded Tara of one of the central messages
of the whole mindfulness program: to learn how to relate differently to
the constantly changing patterns in the mind and the body; to hold the
recurrent patterns of both mind and body in the accepting and open­
hearted embrace of awareness, especially at those times when we feel
tired or down or anxious, when the mind's reactivity and old habits are
likely to be most overwhelming. Tara's words sum it up well: "I can see
the value in noticing that it does ebb and flow and change on its own
and that I don't have to fix it. It's being with it and not being more
afraid of it."

When Things Are Hectic
Hana found that she could practice the breathing space when she was
calm, but she found it much more difficult when things got hectic. "It's
easy when I'm relatively calm. It is also okay when you can see a bad
big black cloud coming and take yourself in hand and do it. But yester­
day and today, I have been really busy. Everybody's been rushed, and
I've been going backward and forward and up and down the escalator."
Hana is sensing that everything is hectic. In this situation, the
practice becomes drawn, unwittingly, into the whirlpool along with ev­
erything else she has to do, and she criticizes herself for not remember­
ing to use it. "It's been awful," she said, "and I should have been breath-

Mindfu lness in Everyday Life

1 95

ing and steadying myself, but it was all too frantic, and I didn't even
think about it today. Things overtook me."
In making "shoulds" for herself, Hana's doing mind is importing
tension into any decision she might make about whether to practice or
not. Instead of simply practicing a three-minute breathing space when
the impulse arises, she ends up only thinking about it. Here we see the
doing mode in all its splendor: measuring the gap between how things
are and how they "should be" and then trying to close the gap. The
practice has become a victim of thinking and striving.

Mindfulness Is Inviting and Forgiving
We now arrive at the critical point. It seems easiest to be mindful at
the times when we least need it. Then, when we most need it, our ca­
pacity to meet the moment with mindfulness seems to evaporate. If we
wish to sidestep this vicious cycle, we need to build up new attitudes to
counterbalance our old habits. Whenever we feel hassled, that is the
perfect moment to take a breathing space. Even if we only manage to
do it after the fact, rather than during whatever is happening, this will
help us build new ways of seeing, knowing, and responding to stressful
situations. This might mean taking a breathing space after that aggra­
vating phone call if not during it or while we're rehashing some diffi­
cult incident that we wish had gone differently. So even if we realize at
the end of the day Oh my gosh-it's eight 0 ' clock at night , and I haven't ac­

tually been in touch with my body or the breath once today , there and then,
right in that moment, as soon as we become aware of it, we can take a
breathing space. That moment is a moment of realization and is now the
perfect moment to practice and to implement the breathing space. Without
our having to worry about it or force it, the practice itself will influ­
ence, in ways both little and not-so-little, our relationship to how our
life is unfolding. With continued practice, the habits of a lifetime of
operating in the doing mode will attenuate and dissolve in the spa­
cious, accepting embrace of mindfulness. In this way, each time we
take a breathing space we are building up increments of a new learning.

1 96

TRAN SFORM ING UNHAPPINESS

So even if we think Oh , I haven't done my practice for several days , we
can seize that very moment and practice. We may think There's no
point; I've missed too much; I might as well pack it in , give up . Those
thoughts can then serve as our cue, as a reminder to practice. Other­
wise, a spiral of rumination has an opportunity to take hold right
then and there as we berate ourselves for not doing what we are
"supposed" to be doing. Ironically, that cycle of rumination might
last at least three minutes ! One more instance of being subverted
by the "coulda, shoulda, woulda,
l1'henever we feel hassled, it is
helpful to take a breathing
space-even if after the fact.

oughta" mentality-or choosing not
to be.
Mindfulness practice is very
forgiving. It beckons to us to start

over again, time after time after time, without j udging us for the times
we haven't managed to remember to drop in on ourselves. So we do it
whenever and wherever we can, as a gesture of kindness toward our­
selves. This orientation and an ongoing willingness to practice now,
whatever happened or didn't happen in that regard in the past, will
strengthen the likelihood that the next time when we really "need" to
be fully present, the breathing space will immediately suggest itself as a
skillful option.

CHOICES WE CAN MAKE AFTER TAKING
A BREATHING S PACE

It is helpful to think of the breathing space as a door through which we
can pass from the hot, murky, cramped, "driven" places in our minds to
a lighter, cooler, more accommodating space. If we see the breathing
space as always the first step in a more mindful response to unpleasant
feelings of unhappiness, anger, fear, and the like, then our initial focus
need only be on that one door. But once through that door, once we
have entered a different space in our minds, a number of other doors lie
before us, leading onward. Each door offers a different option for fur­
ther mindful responding, and we are invited to make a conscious

Mindfulness in Everyday Life

1 97

choice of which door to open next. Our choices may be severely con­
strained by the situation in which we find ourselves. Even so, we al­
ways have the option of returning later to these possibilities to expand
and deepen our practice.

Option

1:

Reentry

The simplest option after we've completed the third step of the breath­
ing space is to leave it at that. With a new mode of mind in place, we
mentally reenter the difficult situation that prompted us to take the
breathing space. We may find the negative thoughts, the unpleasant
feelings, the intense physical sensations, the shouting boss, or the
screaming child are all still here. But the fact that we can approach
them now in being mode, from a gathered, deliberate, more spacious,
and less self-centered perspective can make all the difference.
We can now approach them matter-of-factly, responding skillfully
to the needs of the moment, rather than reacting automatically in ways
that will simply compound the difficulties we experience. Once we are
in this mode of mind, its inherent wisdom may make the next step we
need to take much clearer. And we can support this wiser mode by
staying mindfully present, as best we can, grounded in awareness of our

bodily experience in each moment.
Sometimes the change is very subtle. One participant reported:
"On Wednesday I woke up feeling rotten. I hadn't slept well; I was tired
and thick-headed. I had a day of work ahead of me. I could feel the old
familiar feelings of desperation rising up. As I was lying there feeling
miserable, some part of me remembered my breath, and I took a
breathing space. After it, I lay in bed for a while j ust watching my
breath and tuning in to the sensations in my body. It seems odd, but I
felt different after that-I still felt tired, thick-headed, and fed up, but
it didn't seem like such a disaster! "
Although the shift in feeling tone may be a subtle one, it actually
represents a huge and crucial change in mode of mind. And every tiny
shift of this kind, no matter how subtle, can open up new possibilities
for what happens next.

1 98

TRANSFORMING UNHAPPINESS

It may mean working on your to-do list one task at a time, rather
than getting overwhelmed by all the things left undone. It may mean .
ending a frustrating phone call feeling aggravated but not demeaned or
disrespected. It could mean feeling regretful about snapping at a col­
league without having the feeling that you should beat yourself up over
it again and again during the rest of the day. Maybe it means j ust feel­
ing down when something reminds you of a recent loss but not adding
anger at the situation or yourself, not descending into "I'll never get
over this" doomsaying.
Of course, we always have the option, if time permits, of building
on this new learning by going around again: taking another breathing
space to consolidate the shift to the new, more mindful, mode of mind.
But the danger here is that we could end up approaching the breathing
space in a goal-oriented way-as a tool to "fix" a difficult situation.
From this perspective, if the first breathing space did not "work" in get­
ting rid of unwanted feelings, we might be tempted to try again, per­
haps even harder this time. The risk here is that the attempt to fix
things actually becomes a part of the problem. The "failure" of the first
and possibly subsequent attempts to

opposite of mindfulness.

get rid of negative feelings generates
more negative feelings. This is the ex­
act opposite of mindfulness.
We may find that we need to ex­
plicitly remind ourselves quite fre­
quently that the aim of the three-

minute breathing space is not to dispose of all negative states, instantly
or otherwise, but to allow us to access a mode of mind in which we can
be with them more effectively and with greater clarity. Although this
may not immediately eliminate whatever it is that we don't want to
continue happening, it will give us the freedom and wisdom to respond
in ways that may allow unpleasant feelings and difficult situations to
resolve rather than perpetuate themselves. At the very least, we can
cease feeding them and compounding the suffering.
If we wish to explore the option of using several breathing spaces
back to back, it might be wise to limit ourselves to two cycles of it on

Mindfulness in Everyday Life

1 99

any one occasion. We might keep in mind that the breathing space , used

properly , is merely a method for reminding us of what it would mean and
how it would feel to embody mindfulness in the face of whatever is arising.

Option

2:

The Body Door

As we have emphasized many times, disturbing experiences carry an
unpleasant feeling tone. There are negative feelings, such as dread or
sadness, and often a reaction of aversion or resistance to them, not un­
commonly expressed in changes in the muscles of the face or body,
such as frowning; tightening of the neck, j aw, and shoulder muscles; or
tensing of the lower back. All of these can be directly attended to, and
our primary strategy for transforming our relationship to difficult emo­
tions is to work within this domain of awareness (Chapter 7 ) . So if, fol­
lowing an initial breathing space, we choose to work further on our
emotions, it is natural to turn our attention toward what we are feeling
in the body.
As a first step we direct, as best we can, a friendly, open attention
to the part of the body where we experience the most intense physical
bodily sensations. One way to do this is to use the breath to carry the
attention, breathing into the area on each in-breath, breathing out
from the area on each out-breath, as we learned to do in the body scan.
With each out-breath, any sense of tightness, bracing, or resistance
may release or soften naturally. Where this occurs, the tension and
sense of holding on often dissolve with the outbreath, although by no
means are we trying to make this
happen. If it happens, that's fine,

We may find it helpful to remind ourselves of the general intention to

Once we have brought attention to the physical, bodily manifes­
tations of any resistance or aversion we may be feeling, we can explore
a number of options for staying connected with our feelings. Staying in
touch with them allows for the possibility of their being met and held
in new and different ways. One is simply to continue breathing with
awareness of the sensations, perhaps having the sense of holding them
in a soft, wide, and spacious awareness. Another option is to investi­
gate in detail, with a narrower, intentionally more focused attention,
where the area of intensity begins; where its edges are; where the sensa­
tions are most intense; how, if at all, the sensations change from one
moment to the next. Whatever option we choose, we expend some ef­
fort to keep our awareness alive and to nurture it. We can do this by in­
tentionally infusing it with qualities of interest, investigation, good­
will, and compassion. If we find that we have drifted into an attitude of
forcing or striving, we can gently but firmly disengage from it. Plus, we
can always refresh and enliven our minds by opening and widening the
field of awareness to include other senses in the moment such as
sounds, the fragrance of the air, or the feeling of it on the skin.
We can approach any negative feelings in the same way. We may
find it helpful to remind ourselves to cultivate an accepting, allowing
relationship to these feelings by saying to ourselves It's okay ; whatever it
is it's already here ; let me be open to it. We might pay particular attention
to any changes in the qualities of those feelings as we hold them in
awareness.
With intensely unpleasant feelings, we may find it helpful to use
the strategy of "working the edge." As explained earlier, this means
bringing attention as far into the intensity of the experience as we can
and then maintaining it with a light touch, as best we can, moment by
moment. When the intensity begins to feel overwhelming, we can
gently, in the spirit of self-compassion, shift our attention bit by bit to­
ward some other, more stabilizing and benign focus. For instance, we
might steady ourselves and regroup by focusing on the movements of
the breath until we feel ready to approach the area of greater intensity
again. We can do this by focusing on the breath by itself or together
with awareness of the unpleasant feelings and sensations in the back-

Mindfu lness in Everyday Life

ground ( "breathing with" ) . By testing the water in this way, we
can develop a progressively more accepting relationship to intensely
unpleasant experiences. This in itself is a path of both wisdom and
compassion.
Michelle found herself feeling drained just thinking about an up­
coming family reunion. "I keep telling myself that it should be nice to
visit with everyone after all this time," she said, "but when I think of
booking my flight, I can't seem to follow through." Back at home the
next day, the thought I should get it booked came into her mind once
again. Instead of forcing herself to call the travel agent right then and
there, she decided she would first take a breathing space. A few min­
utes into it, Michelle noticed increased pressure in her chest and tight­
ness in her throat. The thought that her father would be coming to the
reunion with his new partner, Jean, seemed to increase the intensity of
these sensations. Ordinarily, Michelle would have turned away from
looking at this thought pattern more closely, telling herself that it was
up to her to "do the right thing for the family." This time, however, she
was able to recognize her aversion as being an all too familiar response
and decided, instead, to approach the edge of her discomfort. Once she
had connected with her breath at the belly, she moved her attention to
her throat and began to breathe into the tightness. What she discov­
ered was that these sensations were not static: they came and went.
The tightness gave way to a feeling of strain in her neck muscles, and
this would sometimes ease as she breathed out from this region. She
noticed that the thought You ought to welcome Jean into the family

TRANSFORMING UNHAPPINESS

Option

3:

The Thought Door

In the first step of the breathing space we may become aware that emo­
tionally charged thoughts are the most salient feature of our experi­
ence. From Chapter 8, we may recognize among these some of our re­
curring patterns of negative thoughts. If these thoughts are still a
dominant feature of your experience as you complete Step 3 of the
breathing space, you have the option of opening the Thought Door by
making a deliberate decision to relate differently to your thinking. This
may involve
•

Writing down the thoughts

•

Watching the thoughts come and go

•

Viewing your thoughts as mental events rather than as facts

•

Relating to thoughts in the same way that you would to sounds

•

Identifying a particular thought pattern as one of your recurring

•

Gently asking yourself:

old mental grooves
Am I overtired ?
Am I j umping to conclusions ?
Am I thinking in black-and-white terms ?
Am I expecting perfection ?
The key idea is that, based on our previous experience of medita­
tion practice, we probably will have already discovered some effective
ways to relate differently and more creatively to negative thoughts
when they arise. In the breathing space, we can now make use of those
various approaches to remind ourselves that we are not our thoughts
and that thoughts are not facts ( even the ones that say they are ! ) . This
reminder alone can have profound effects that accumulate over time.

Option

4:

The Door of Skillful Action

A fourth choice we can make after the breathing space is to open the
Door of Skillful Action. We have emphasized the importance of bring-

Mindfulness in Everyday Life

203

ing an accepting and allowing awareness to difficult and unpleasant ex­
periences ( Chapter 7 ) . But this new orientation does not mean we have
to be passive. Often, the most appropriate response to unpleasant feel­
ings, once we have acknowledged them, will be to take some consid­
ered action, to act on the basis of conscious choice.
The motivation underlying our actions at these times will deter­
mine whether they turn out to be helpful or unhelpful. As we saw in
the mouse-in-the-maze experiment (Chapter 6 ) , the same action can
have very different consequences depending on whether our motiva­
tion is based on avoidance or openness to experience. If we are
driven to get rid of the unpleasant feelings, our actions will most
likely backfire, digging us deeper into unhappiness. On the other
hand, if we are motivated by genuine desire to take better care of
ourselves, our actions can be a skillful way to bring greater ease and
relief.
Betty used the breathing space to find some more room for her
needs in a pressure-filled j ob. As an accountant, she felt herself most
vulnerable around tax season, and at the end of the fiscal year. This of­
ten meant long days and weekends at the office with little down time.
Recognizing that her last depression started under these circumstances,
Betty made a point of going out in the afternoon to get a cup of her fa­
vorite blended coffee and would drink it while sitting on one of those
tall barstools watching the other customers. Sometimes she would pick
up dinner at her neighborhood bistro to get some relief from cooking at
home. "In the past, I 'd postpone going out until the pile of work I had
to face was done," she said. "What's new is that I realize, 'now and not

later': that I need to slow down and take time for myself in the mo­
ments that really matter."
Low mood particularly affects two sorts of activity: It makes the
things we used to find pleasurable less enj oyable, causing us to lose in­
terest in them or to give them up altogether. It also makes it difficult to
stay on top of the daily tasks of living that may not give us pleasure but
do give us a sense of being responsible people exercising control in our
own lives. In many ways, subtle and not so subtle, depression and low
mood undermine us by robbing us of the energy to do the things that

204

TRANSFORMING UNHAPPINESS

would nourish us the most. Simply engaging or reengaging in such ac­
tivity can have unsuspected power.
So the fourth possibility following a breathing space is to inten­
tionally choose to do something that would once have given us (a)
pleasure (such as having a hot bath, going for a walk with the dog, vis­
iting a friend, listening to music that makes us feel good) or (b) a sense
(no matter how small) of mastery, satisfaction, achievement, or control
(such as clearing out a cupboard or drawer; doing something that we
have been putting off, such as paying a bill, writing a letter to a family
member or a friend, clearing off your desktop) . Even a tiny amount of
one such activity can give us a sense that we can have an effect in the
world. And even a small effect can counteract the sense of helplessness
and lack of control that often accompanies low mood. In the case of
very anxious, fearful moods, it may be particularly helpful to take ac­
tion by facing and taking on situations that we have hitherto avoided.
It's also both helpful and realistic to break tasks down into smaller steps
and tackle only one step at a time. In all cases, it's very helpful to remem­
ber to congratulate ourselves for completing a task or even part of a task.
In exploring the most effective way to take action in responding
mindfully to a depressed mood, it may be helpful to keep two things in
mind. First, low mood undermines and reverses the motivation process itself.
Normally we can wait until we want to do something, and then j ust do
it. However, when we feel low, we actually have to mobilize ourselves
to do something before we want to do it. Second, the tiredness and fa­
tigue that occur in depression can be misleading. When we are not de­
pressed, tiredness means we need to rest. In this case, rest refreshes us.

The fatigue of depression , however, is often not normal tiredness ; it may call
not for rest but for increased activity , if only for a short while. Rest can
worsen the fatigue. Part of taking care of ourselves in such moments is
to stay in the flow of life, to keep participating in normal activities,
even if our mood and thoughts seem to say there's no point.
The most challenging times are often when depression comes out
of the blue, such as on waking up. Here too our initial response can be
to start by taking a breathing space. It is also important to ask some
specific questions:

Mindfu lness in Everyday Life

205

•

"How can I best be kind to myself right now ?"

•

"What is the best gift I can give to myself at this moment ?"

•

"I do not know how long this mood will last so how can I best
look after myself until it passes ?"

•

"What would I do at this moment for someone I cared about
who was feeling this way ? How can I look after myself in the
same way?"

Of course, even with the best of intentions, sometimes we won't
be able to catch ourselves; it may feel that we have gone over an edge,
into a more persistent and intense negative mood state. At such times
it's important that, however weakly or fleetingly, we remember that the
practice of mindfulness is still a healthy way to take care of ourselves.
What we need at such times is actually no different from what we find
helpful in responding mindfully to our less intense negative moods. Of
course, it may be more challenging to relate differently to our negative
thoughts in such moments. Perhaps even the impact of engaging in
some mood-lifting activity may be severely muted under the circum­
stances. Nevertheless it is still better to bring whatever degree of mindful­
ness we can to this moment and take some appropriate action to care for our­
selves than to sink further into a state of ruminative brooding.
What we are saying here is that the task, when things are tough, is
really to focus on each moment: to handle each moment as best we can. If
our approach to how we relate to a difficult moment shifts even by one
percent, that is potentially an enormous shift to have made because it af­
fects the next moment, and the next moment, and so on; so one seem­
ingly small change can have a surprisingly large impact down the road.

THE FREEDOM TO CHOOS E

In reflecting on what he had learned from his participation in the
mindfulness program, Louis singled out the way in which he found the
breathing space to be an important ally:
"I realized many things, but one I'd like to share. I've realized how

TRAN SFORMING UNHAPPINESS

206

much I really push myself. This is something I know how to do really
well. So I spent lots of time thinking about how I would be able to rec­
ognize it. The three-minute breathing space helps a lot. And I am do­
ing it a number of times throughout the day. Sometimes three times,
sometimes five times, sometimes whenever there is a big hesitation or
not knowing . . . or when there are still six more things left to do and I
have half an hour or an hour left to go; that's when it's really great. It
really helps me . . . j ust to sit . . . to do this acknowledgment . . . and
then to hold this not knowing . . . because sometimes I really don't
know where this feeling of pressure comes from. Do I really have to
push myself and say that in the next half an hour I will finish the proj ­
ect ? Sometimes I j ust stay with I don't know . . . and it's okay not to
know, and it's okay also for me not to take an action to finish every­
thing. Because it's so easy for me to take an action, and that's where a
lot of stress in my life comes from, j ust from taking too many actions,
having too many things on my plate and doing it all . . . because I feel I
won't go to sleep unless I do this so everything is finished. I have to
know it's completed. And sometimes it's j ust not necessary. This is very
new for me . . not to do certain things . . . and it feels okay. In a way
.

I'm also changing my attitude toward time. The time that I have, the
time I can give myself for doing something, you know ? I think I am less
frantic because of that."
Louis was raising a very important point. There's no simple way to
answer the question of what different people need. Some of us who
are too busy may need to find a balance that involves stepping away
from endless activity. Others might find we're not doing enough of the
things we need to be doing, and so the problem is finding a way of
balancing our lives so that we can be more engaged and enlivened at
certain times. One way to begin is to bring awareness to where we are
and to the feeling of what is going on with us right now. This gives us
more sensitivity to appraise our inner and outer situation and condi­
tion accurately-not j ust cerebrally, but through mindful awareness.
This awareness in turn expands the field of choices available to us and
increases the likelihood that we will make healthy, wise, skillful

Mindfulness in Everyday Life

20 7

choices rather than be carried along by the momentum of what we ha­
bitually do.
The expansion of choices may be instantaneous and unexpected,
as Kate found out when she picked up her fifteen-year-old son from
school after having been away for a few days.
"I had forgotten how grumpy fifteen-year-olds can be," she said. "I
asked him how school had been that day. He said angrily, 'You always
say the same thing. '
"I paused, and I was aware o f a feeling o f contraction i n my chest.
It was very distinct. I recognized rising tension and irritation. I would
normally have reacted."
For Kate, somehow, j ust that pause, that instantaneous acknowl­
edgment, gathering, and awareness of the body, was enough to let the
moment pass without reacting.
"I would usually have gotten angry at him or driven home in a
cold silence," Kate went on. "Instead, I turned to him and found myself
saying 'I've missed you.' And you know what ? He turned to me and
smiled. I had not seen that smile in ages. It was a miracle ."
The three-minute breathing space is intended to provide us with
j ust that kind of sensitivity and potential for choice when we come
face to face with old patterns. These old patterns may relate to think­
ing about ourselves in a certain way or dealing with our moods in un­
healthy ways or keeping ourselves insanely busy while blaming it on
outside circumstances. Those habitual tendencies are still going to be
here; mindfulness practice will not instantly change all that. But what
it can do is to give us a moment's pause and present us with choices we
had not seen before. Our starting point can be centered with the
breath, fully acknowledging where we are now, right in this moment.
Otherwise we can j ust be carried away as we always have been, reacting
automatically. This is what Louis was realizing.
"I actually appreciate this state of not knowing," he explained. "I
really do. Because it gives me a way of really pausing, and it opens my
mind into right now. And somehow there is a moment when an idea
comes to me and then I say yes or no. But also, holding it in awareness

208

TRAN SFORM ING UNHAPPINESS

is somehow important, rather than j ust doing something automatically,
which is what I would tend to do."
In practicing using the breathing space regularly, we gradually see
that there is a way of changing our relationship to ourselves and the
world. We find we can have a new relationship to aspects of ourselves
that we previously found difficult and a new relationship to situations
that we have been avoiding. Internal or external, these situations tend
to evoke the same reaction in us: avoidance, escape, suppression. So as
not to succumb to these unwise maneuvers, we tum toward whatever it
is that has evoked these reactions. Because our habitual reactions of
aversion to what we find difficult are fundamental to what gets us stuck
in unhappiness, this conscious response of turning toward such difficul­
ties, even if merely a one-degree turn in this direction, can bring about
a fundamental shift in the way we live our lives.

that speaks as much to adults as to children, Arnold Lobel recounts a
day in the life of Toad. As the day began, Toad sat up in bed and wrote
on a piece of paper: A list of things to do today. Then he wrote: Wake up .
As he had already done that, he was able to cross it out straightaway.
He then wrote on the paper a plan for the rest of his day: Eat breakfast ,
G e t dressed, Go to Frog's house , Take walk with Frog, Eat lunch , Take nap ,
Play games with Frog, Eat supper, Go to sleep . He got up and worked his
way through the list, crossing off each item as it was completed. When
he got to the house of his friend, Frog, he announced: "My list tells me
that we will go for a walk." So they did, and Toad crossed Take walk

with Frog off his list. Then disaster struck: a strong wind blew the list
out of Toad's hand. Frog was all for running after the list to catch it.
But poor Toad j ust could not do that-it was not on his list of things to
do ! So, while Toad sat there, immobilized, Frog ran after the list, mile

211

212

RECLA I M I N G YOUR L I FE

after mile-but in vain-he j ust could not catch it and returned
empty-handed to the disconsolate Toad. Toad could not remember any
of the things that were left on his list to do. So he j ust sat and did noth­
ing. Frog sat with him. Eventually Frog pointed out that it was getting
dark and that they should go to sleep. "Go to sleep ! " Toad shouted tri­
umphantly. "That was the last thing on my list ! " So Toad wrote on the
ground with a stick Go to sleep. Then he crossed it out, delighted that
he could, at last, cross out his whole day. And then Frog and Toad went
to sleep.
Poor One-Mode Toad ! Yet many of us often behave j ust like Toad,
as if doing were the only mental mode available to us. Too often our
lives seem to be little more than one long "to do" list.
It is not so much making "to do" lists that is the problem. The
problem is our sense of impending doom if we don't get through the
list. That, and the myopic narrowing of our lives that can result. At
one place in Full Catastrophe Living, Jon tells the story of a man who
was taking the MBSR program as a way to prevent a recurrence of a
heart attack he had suffered eighteen months earlier. His name was Pe­
ter. At ten o'clock at night, with the floodlights on in his driveway, he
found himself setting up to wash his car. Why ? Because he had had the
idea that he needed to wash the car at some point that day. Since it was
on his "to do" list , and since he had always operated from the convic­
tion that if something was on the list it had to get done, there was no
question that he had to do it. Understandably, this attitude toward life
had led to a sense of feeling driven. Peter was perpetually tense and
anxious. This orientation to life threatened his heart and his health
without his even being aware of it most of the time. As a result of his
mindfulness training, Peter was becoming more aware of his patterns of
mind and could recognize that his thoughts were just thoughts. In an in­
stant, he realized that he didn't have to wash his car. He was in a posi­
tion to choose whether to continue or to stop and relax a bit before go­
ing to bed. He called it quits.
Living his life ruled by his "to do" lists harmed Peter's cardiovascu­
lar health and threatened his life. When those of us who struggle with
relentless unhappiness allow our interior worlds to be ruled by our "to

Fully Alive

213

do" lists, our emotional health is damaged. This puts our very lives at
risk. Not only is the doing mode ineffective at staving off depression,
but it constricts and cramps our lives so that we end up living in a tiny
comer of the world available to us.
Although we may not fully realize it, as human beings, every sin­
gle one of us can live in the open spaciousness of the being mode far,
far, more than we do. The more we make that possibility real for our­
selves, even in tiny ways, the more we can enrich our own lives and en­
hance our mental health. Is it not wise, then, to reserve our use of the
doing mode for those areas of life in which it is a skillful, effective re­
sponse, and instead put more of our energies into the cultivation of be­
ing ? This more mindful way of being takes some time and courage of
course. But we can draw significant encouragement and inspiration
from those who have engaged in exactly this kind of interior work
through their participation in MBCT, keeping in mind that those for­
mal programs lasted only eight weeks and reduced the risk of relapse by
half in people who had been recurrently depressed.
"I haven't felt the same. In situations in the past that would
have knocked me sideways, or irritated me very much, I
would have got upset about it and worked up-that j ust
doesn't happen so often. It's been amazing the things that
have happened in this short period-to stay calm without
spiraling out of contro!."
"Before I came here I didn't know what it was like to live with­
out pressure. I might have had some idea when I was five
years old, but I can't remember much of that. I have been
shown a different way, and it's so simple. It seems to me So

that's what everybody else does all the time. Nobody bothered to
let me in on it before."
"We've learned something from this, and it's now within us.
We know it's never going to leave us again. It's the fact that I
know it's here and that I have to deal with myself, instead of

214

RECLA I M I N G YOUR LIFE

having to rely on anybody else's helping hand by having to
rely on them and then feeling like a failure because I couldn't
do it by myself. It's the fact that now I know there's some­
thing in me that gives me a handle on myself and the things
that happen."
Our theories, our research, and the stories of other people's experi­
ence in their mindfulness programs all point to the importance of culti­
vating awareness intentionally. But in the end, all of this is still no sub­
stitute for personal experience. We each need to see for ourselves the
effects of both the doing mode and the being mode on the moment-to­
moment quality of our lives. To develop such experience requires that
we cultivate mindfulness in our daily lives, for that is the arena in
which most of our anguish arises and is played out. It is in the conduct
and interactions of our everyday lives that we have a chance to become
more aware of the consequences of the runaway doing mode and also
to feel firsthand the transformative possibilities of dropping into being.
Ultimately, living with mindful awareness, grounded in the being
mode of mind, is a way of being fully awake, fully alive, and fully one­
self, whatever and however that might tum out to be. It is not inimical
to getting things done or to bringing about important changes in your
life or in the world. It is very much about wise doing, a doing that
emerges and flows out of the domain of being-"mindful doing" if you
will. First we recognize our experience as being j ust as it is. Then, if we
choose, we might intentionally engage in some appropriate action to
take care of ourselves or respond compassionately to the particular situ­
ation, as the following two people did, each in their own way.

PEG G Y 'S S TO RY

Peggy worked in a demanding j ob, advising caregivers in several differ­
ent settings how best to handle their most difficult cases. Every morn­
ing she would wake with a feeling of dread and immediately begin wor­
rying about how she was going to cope with the problems she had to

Fully Alive

215

confront that day. The specifics changed from day to day, but the un­
derlying theme was always the same: fear that she would not be able to
cope with problem situations, that she would not be able to come up
with answers to the difficulties presented to her, that things would get
out of control, that she would not meet expectations, that everything
would go dreadfully wrong. On the worst days, the specific worries
would trigger recurrent, more generalized feelings of fear. She would
feel her heart sink at the bleak prospects before her: Oh , God , it's al­

ways going to be like this . I ' ll never be able to hack it; it will always continue ;
I ' ll never feel free or relaxed.
Before she encountered mindfulness training, Peggy had tried to
deal with these worries by getting some sense of control over the spe­
cific problems that were uppermost in her mind each day as she lay in
bed. She would identify the worry, anticipate what could go wrong,
think what she could do to prevent it, reassure herself that she had
done all that was necessary, or plan new ways to fix the problem and
avoid the situations she feared and dreaded so much. Sometimes this
approach seemed to take the edge off Peggy's fear. But there was no
lasting effect. The next morning she would wake up in j ust as much
dread, worried about a new set of problems.
What did Peggy do differently as a result of her mindfulness train­
ing ? First, she concentrated on bringing attention to her body even be­
fore getting out of bed. She became aware of sensations of tension in
the stomach and of an overall stiffness in the body, around the tension,
as if she was already resisting it. Next she focused her attention on
what she was feeling: the dread, the fear, the anxiety. With that came
an awareness of j ust how unpleasant these feelings were, how much she
hated them and wanted to be rid of them, and, with a sigh, a realization
of j ust how drained and weary these feelings made her. At the same
time came the insight that it was simply impossible to problem-solve or
fix these feelings in any lasting way. She realized that, with effort, she
might be able to achieve some degree of control over the problems that
were most pressing each day, but that at night, any tenuous sense of
control she might have achieved during the day was lost. It felt as if
some part of her mind j ust completely unraveled. She realized, then

RECLAI MING YOUR L I FE

21 6

and there, that her "night mind" was conspiring with her "early morn­
ing mind" . . . to zap her, as she put it, with a new set of worries, the in­
stant she woke up. It felt as though there was part of her mind that
would always work against her, by narrowing down to fixate incessantly
on the content of her worries.
Through cultivating mindfulness, Peggy discovered that when she
widened her attention to include the full scope of her experience in
the moment, she was able to identify and distinguish four different as­
pects of her experience: ( 1 ) unpleasant physical sensations in the body;
( 2 ) unpleasant feelings, such as dread and fear; ( 3 ) previously unspo­
ken negative thoughts about the feelings; and ( 4 ) the worries centered
on the particular problems of the day.
Inspired by this wider perspective, Peggy made a crucial shift in
the way she related to her difficulties . Rather than struggling with her
feared images of the future, generated by all her worrying, Peggy reori­
ented herself to face the present reality and the actuality of her experi­
ences in the moment . She realized that she simply could not control
the content of her worries-these were already formed while she was
asleep-and that the more she rushed around mentally, trying to fix
them, the more tense she became. Not only that, she realized that fo­
cusing on the content of specific worries could never provide a long­
term solution because, as she said, "There will always be something." If
one worry was put to rest, another would very quickly pop up to take its
place. She realized that, as long as she focused on the specific thought
products generated endlessly by her worrying mind, there could be no
long-term change in what was producing them in the first place. She
was perpetually dealing with symptoms rather than addressing the un­
derlying cause.
In response to these revelations, Peggy settled into a practice she
developed for herself. Each morning, she turned to face whatever expe­
rience awaited her as she woke up. She would greet the horrible lump
in her stomach or throat, fully acknowledging how bad it felt: "There
you are; I see you." Then, not running or turning away from it, she
would explore the horrible feeling as a feeling. What was it like ? What
other feelings were here with it? She would acknowledge that the pres-

Fully Alive

ence of the feeling meant there was something somewhere that she was
perceiving as threatening. But, and here was a maj or shift, she no
longer concerned herself with the particulars of the threat. She did
not try fixing a difficult or threatening imagined situation in the fu­
ture. Now, instead, her primary concern was to respond with greater
awareness and acceptance to the immediate, present situation of feel­

ing threatened. With this shift came the recognition that kindness
and gentleness, rather than analytical problem solving, were what
was actually required-You don't need to know what the details are

breathing a gentle awareness
into the feeling, not as a clever way to get rid of it but in the service of
extending goodwill to all aspects of her experience. Often, as she
breathed awareness into the feeling, an image would arise in which the
horrible feeling was seen as a rock on a beach, and the sea would gently
surround it, the waves tracking the movements of her breath, each
wave in turn lightly touching it with care and a concern to look after
it, softly surrounding it with warmth and compassion. The effect was to
take the sharpness off both the rock and the physical sensations ac­
companying the horrible feeling and to reduce the size of both. The
feeling would not necessarily go away, but it would be less central, less
an all-consuming center of struggle and conflict.
If there was no time for the image, Peggy would deliberately focus
with kindness and gentleness ( "That's what the feeling is telling me
that I need") on whatever she was doing to prepare for the day, as a way
to bring a sense of goodwill and caring for herself into whatever diffi­
culties lay ahead.
Peggy found that the dread still came, but it came less often, and
when it did come she was able to be matter-of-fact with it. Rather than
calling her experience of fear and dread "wrong" or interpreting it as a

21 8

RECLAIMING YOUR LIFE

sign that she was deficient or that there was something profoundly
wrong with her life, she now saw the feeling as a message reminding
her of the need to be gentle, the need to be kind, the need to take good
care of herself in a stressful time.
Like the novice in Chapter 4, Peggy had seen that trying to make
unpleasant thoughts and feelings go away by attempting to fix them or
shut them out did not help her, but only increased her sense of help­
lessness. Her worries had constantly sucked her back in because she
thought they ought to be solvable. Her mind kept activating the doing
mode: fixing, analyzing, j udging, comparing. Eventually she came to
see the whole mind pattern as an opportunity to switch into being
mode. She realized that with gentle persistence she could pay atten­
tion, intentionally, in each present moment of now to whatever she
was experiencing, inwardly, and outwardly. She saw that holding what­
ever

was arising in non-j udgmental awareness was all that was required.

It usually helped to broaden her field of awareness to include her body
as a whole. This allowed Peggy both to see what was happening from
moment to moment and to relate to her experience in a direct,
nonconceptual way. She had found a different place to stand: behind
the torrent of thoughts and feelings of the cascading mind. This was a
little like standing behind a waterfall; she could move in close to it,
seeing its force, but not getting dragged along with it into the depths.

DAVID ' S STORY

From the moment he looked at the raisin during the first class with its
wrinkles, glistening highlights, and deep rich colors, David had be­
come really enthusiastic about exploring mindfulness. The experience
had reawakened in him memories of the times he had valued most in
his life: times long ago when as a young man he sat on the dunes of a
deserted beach, looking across a glistening sea to the horizon; or wak­
ing, fully refreshed, on a Sunday morning, drawing back the curtains to
reveal an expanse of freshly fallen snow. These were times when he'd
felt at one with the world, fully present and filled with gratitude for be­
ing alive.

For David, the realization that he could change his experience by
changing the way he paid attention in each moment was immensely
empowering. He threw himself into bringing mindfulness to each as­
pect of his day. Over time he learned to prioritize giving attention to
physical sensations as a way to stay connected with the immediacy of
his experience. As soon as he awoke, he took three deliberate, mindful
breaths, sensing his abdomen rise and fall with each one, using the sen­
sations in his body as a focus to gather his attention before it became
entangled and dispersed in anticipating and planning the day ahead. In
the shower, he used the first contact of the water as a reminder to enter
fully into the present moment, to tune in to the sensations in his
body-the tingling on his skin where the water splattered, the move­
ments in his limbs as he rubbed soap over his body. As he dressed, he
deliberately exaggerated the stretching and bending movements he
made as he pulled on his shirt, tied his shoelaces, reminding himself to
tune in to the sensations in his muscles, j ust as he had in practicing the
mindful yoga.
David changed the way he ate breakfast with the family. The radio
no longer delivered the news, the disastrous state of the wider world
and the local traffic, dimly attended in the background as the family
got ready for the day. He no longer flicked through the morning paper,
automatically placing food in his mouth, barely aware whether it was
toast or cornflakes, coffee or tea, or which of the children it was who
was shouting about not being able to find a bookbag. Now he held this
time with greater awareness. He dedicated it to mindful presence: Da­
vid's intention was to be here for these moments of his morning, for
himself and for his family. After all, wasn't this his life ?
David's way t o work crossed some railroad tracks. Often the barri­
ers would be down, blocking the way for cars, allowing a train to pass.
In the past, he would respond with a sigh-"Oh God, not again ! "­
and sit there, hunched over the steering wheel. Now his response was
"Okay, I 've got an opportunity to do a breathing space here." He did as
many of the three steps as time allowed-with his eyes open of course,
to catch the time when the barrier lifted. Reconnected with the here
and now, he put conscious effort into driving mindfully, attending to
the sensations where his fingers touched the steering wheel, to the

220

RECLA I M I N G YOUR L I FE

contact points of his back and buttocks with the seat, and to the rele­
vant sights through the windshield-the details of the other cars on
the road, their colors, their patterns of movement. By the time he ar­
rived in the parking lot at work, he no longer felt exhausted by the
prospect of the day ahead.
Through his conscious efforts to be fully present in more of his
moments, David had transformed and enriched the quality not only of
his mornings, but also of his evenings and weekends. Family life became
more of a pleasure than a burden once again. But what about the rest
of his life, the bulk of his waking weekday hours that were spent at work ?
Here the picture was not so simple. Much of David's work in­
volved "being in his head"-thinking, planning, and writing reports,
all under tight and pressing deadlines. Although he was much more
ready to take on each day, David's attempts to bring mindfulness to
these activities j ust "didn't seem to work"-it didn't seem possible to
approach them in the same mindful way that he could approach eating
his breakfast or listening to music or being with the family. He might
begin his work with a clear intention to remain mindfully present, but
within moments of sitting down to answer e-mails, write a report, or
develop a plan or meeting agenda for his clients, he would "lose it"­
he would get carried away, drawn into the task, the need to deliver an
elegant solution, the need to look smart and avoid screwing up. Every
now and then he would become aware of how much he had lost con­
tact with the moment, but this would j ust make things worse-he
would begin to feel disappointed, resentful of the way his work seemed
to be robbing him of the possibilities for happiness and clarity that he
had begun to experience in other areas of his life.
From time to time, it would occur to David to take a breathing
space. Sometimes this was really helpful, allowing him to gather him­
self, regroup, and see more clearly what was going on. More often, he
would emerge from Step 3 feeling that he still wasn't present with the
spaciousness and clarity he was experiencing in other areas of his life.
At such times, his main feeling was one of pressure to get back to the
task at hand-to get the current assignment out of the way as quickly
as possible, and then he could begin to explore how to be more mindful

Fully Alive

221

at work. But, of course, as soon as he finished one assignment, the next
was sitting there waiting, calling for his attention. So he would im­
merse himself in that one to get it out of the way as soon as possible­

then he might have the leisure to be mindful. But, like the end of the
rainbow, that goal seemed to recede constantly despite his efforts to
reach it.
For a while, David grudgingly resigned himself to the fact that
work simply had to be endured; his workplace seemed a no-go area as
far as mindfulness was concerned. So he decided to put his energies
into being mindful before and after work and to "shut down" while he
was there, to j ust plow ahead with what needed to get done. But the
sense that something was awry would not go away. He began to fanta­
size about giving up his j ob, moving the family to the country and liv­
ing a simple life, growing their own food, tending a few animals, per­
haps becoming a potter. He wondered about working even harder and
longer for a few years, so that he could save enough to give it all up.
Fortunately, David continued to practice mindfulness and also to
explore it more through reading books on meditation, listening to taped
talks, and attending live talks by meditation teachers. Together with his
own practice, this immersion led over time to a shift in David's approach.
The first thing that was immensely helpful was when he came across a
clear statement in one of the books he was reading that mindfulness was
for all of life, not j ust for the margins, where it might be easiest to culti­
vate. From this, he got the clear message that his attempt to partition his
life into zones where he would be mindful and those where he would not
was simply not viable. Next he became aware that he was not alone in the
kind of problems he faced-even famous meditation teachers did not
find it easy to bring mindfulness to work that involved a lot of "head"
tasks ! Thich Nhat Hahn, a renowned and highly respected Vietnamese
meditation teacher who has introduced thousands in the West to mind­
fulness through his numerous books and retreats, said at one point that
he found it possible to be mindful when binding books by hand, but diffi­
cult when writing them. Another meditation teacher, also a writer, re­
counted how he almost had to chain himself to his computer each morn­
ing to ensure that he would get far enough into his writing for the words

222

RECLAI M I N G YOUR L I FE

to begin to flow. David found these admissions enormously liberating.
The fact that he found it difficult to combine mindfulness with "head"
tasks didn't mean something was wrong with him. It was an inherent as­
pect of these verbal-conceptual tasks that it was difficult to sustain
awareness. Another well-known teacher described how he would shift
mental mode by tuning in to sensory awareness for a minute or two at
least once every half hour while writing or working on other "head" tasks:
he might mindfully walk around the outside of his house, feeling the
movements of his body, the coolness of the fresh air on his face, hearing
the sounds of the birds. In this way he was checking in, however briefly,
to being mode, reconnecting with

awareness to the world around
us can keep us from slipping
too far away from being mode.

Inspired in this way, David re­
newed his intention to bring mind­
fulness, as best he could, into his
work situation. He found it a great

relief to acknowledge explicitly the difficulty of what he was trying to
do, rather than feeling that it was something he "should" have been
able to do and feeling like a failure. He also found some benefit from
the "mode breaks," which for him often took the form of standing up­
right, gently stretching, focusing on his breathing, on the sensations in
the soles of his feet where he could feel grounded, connected to the
earth below, and on physical sensations throughout his body as he
gently stretched upward. But he still found himself making negative
comparisons with the levels of presence and clarity that he was able to
sustain outside work-he still felt a long way away from that kind of
mindfulness. The doing mode would not let him forget there was still a
gap between what he had now and what he wanted to achieve.
And then, at one point, he happened to take another look at med­
itation teacher Larry Rosenberg's guidelines for mindful living:

Five steps for practicing mindfulness throughout the day :
1 . When possible , do j ust one thing at a time.

2 . Pay full attention to what you are doing.

Fully Alive

223

3. When the mind wanders from what you are doing, bring it
back.
4. Repeat step number three several billion times.
5. Investigate your distractions.
David had found Steps 1-4 invaluable guides to being more mind­
ful in his wider life; he especially appreciated the wisdom and humor of
Step 4. But he had never really gotten into Step 5 , and, in fact, was not
really sure what it meant. So he decided that it might be good to in­
clude some breathing spaces-after all, the instructions for Step 1 of
the breathing space invited him to become aware of what was going on
in his experience: thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations. Up to this
point he had treated this step very cursorily, giving a brief nod of ac­
knowledgment to his experience before passing on to, as he saw it, the
real business of Steps 2 and 3. So now he lingered longer over Step 1 ,
intentionally looking a little more closely at what thoughts, feelings,
and physical sensations he was experiencing each time he took a
"mode break" at work. And he was shocked by what he found: the ex­
tent of the unhappiness, discontent, and longing in his feelings; the
number of times his thoughts revolved around "I don't want this-I
want that"; the levels of tension, resistance, and aversion he discovered
in his body. David was appalled. But he was also aware of the begin­
nings of a sense of compassion for the pain that he now recognized.

As he persisted with his exploratory breathing spaces, David be­
came increasingly aware that his doing mind was very busy. What was
it up to ? It was busy doing what it was always doing: computing the
match or mismatch-the size of the gap-between goals and the cur­
rent state of affairs. For David, operating in doing mode meant that he
was comparing the state in which he found himself at work with the
mindful, clear, peaceful state that he longed for, creating further un­
happiness in the process. It came to him that what he was experiencing
was "craving"-a longing for things to be other than they are. Over
and over again, he became aware of j ust how unhappy this was making
him. Eventually, he knew deep in his bones, not j ust in his head, that
he was creating this suffering himself. And, with that insight came a
compassionate response: why not do yourself a favor and let go ? The
words "I do not need to be happy" came to him. As he said these words
to himself, David experienced a wonderful sense of lightness come over
him, as if a burden that he had been carrying for too long had suddenly
been lifted from him. And he felt
happy !

experience the same clarity and
peace there that he knows is available to him in his wider life, but he
can sit more lightly with his work situation. Like Peggy, he is able to re­
spond with more kindness and compassion, to take better care of him­
self in this difficult setting. He knows now, deep down, that mindful­
ness is much more than paying closer attention to the color of the trees
or the sounds of the birds, delightful as these are. He knows that mind­
fulness also provides a way to discern those patterns of mind that serve
us and those patterns of mind that create and perpetuate suffering. And
he has discovered what each of us may discover in our own way: that
we have a source of profound wisdom within our own minds and bodies
and hearts.
It is not that difficult situations, worries, memories, people, are
somehow neutralized by our practice of mindfulness, or that we become
indifferent to them. Rather, that the space we make for them when we

RECLAIMING YOUR L I FE

226

bring present-moment awareness to them is bigger; big enough for
them to become only part of our experience. We may find ourselves
starting to make more room in the present moment for realizing and
embodying the full spectrum of who we already are, wherever we are.
We may come to trust ourselves in new and different ways. We may dis­
cover that we are okay as we are and that we can accept ourselves as we
are. We may begin to feel a growing sense of gratitude for the life we al­
ready have, rather than grasping at the one we fantasize about. We may
decide to accept the chance to see and to savor the wonders of the life
available to us, as our life is unfolding moment by moment. This is the
great adventure of mindfulness, the great adventure of being alive.
When our minds are incessantly preoccupied with the rewards or
dangers that may await us at the end of our j ourney, we are cutting our­
selves off from the richness of life itself, and from our ability to recog­
nize it in the texture of each moment along the way. In any one mo­
ment, this may seem no great loss-but a whole life of lost moments is
a whole life lost.
The tragedy for too many of us is not that our lives are too short,
but that we take so long before we start to live them. The source of wis­
dom we discover from the practice of mindfulness, if we allow it, will
eventually show us the immense and tragic suffering that stems from
unawareness. It will allow us to see, to dwell in, and to treasure the
deep peace that lies at the heart of each moment if we have the cour­
age to cultivate awareness, here and now. It will allow us to experience
being fully alive-here and now, while we have the chance.

THE

practices in this book as you have been going along, perhaps you are
now drawn to systematically engage in and experience the whole pro­
gram for yourself. In this chapter we take you step by step through the
eight-session mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for depression pro­
gram. The best way to approach this work is to set aside an eight-week
period in which you can commit to spending an hour each day engag­
ing in the various meditation practices and exercises outlined here.

CAUT I O N
A s w e noted at the start o f this book, i f you are currently
expe riencing an episode of clinical dep ression (see Chapter

1 ), we advise you not to e mbark on this p rog ram in its
entirety now. We suggest you wait until the worst is over
and you are feeling better.

As with acquiring any new skill, engaging in the mindfulness prac­
tices described here will involve something of a shift in how we ap­
proach learning. Take swimming as an example. There comes a point
when the teacher has to stop telling us how and invite us into the wa228

Bringing It All Together

229

tef. Describing how to stay afloat, no matter how good the description,
is simply not enough; we need to experience it for ourselves, directly.
The same is true for mindfulness practice. As with swimming, it can
feel a bit intimidating to make the transition from talking about it to
actually experiencing it firsthand ( especially for those of us who have
gotten used to being pretty competent in other areas of life ) . In both
cases, some persistence in practice will be required. A short dip in the
water will not be enough to learn to swim. Similarly, a session or two
dipping into meditation may not be that useful in the long term. Mind­
fulness meditation can feel exciting and illuminating at times, but it
can also feel downright boring, especially in the early stages, until we
learn how to work with mind states and feeling states such as boredom.
At different times, we certainly will encounter restlessness, frustration,
and impatience, as well as many other mind states and body states.
That is not a problem at all, as long as we remember that it is possible
to hold it all lightly in awareness in any moment.
Week by week, we introduce new elements to the daily practice,
so that over the eight weeks you will be continually building on, as well
as deepening, what you've already learned. It's important to take your
time with the meditation practices. Follow along with the instructions
and the guidance on the CD as best you can, even if it feels difficult,
boring, or repetitive at times. If something feels difficult, our outcome­
oriented doing-obsessed minds may be tempted to rush on to the next
practice, hoping to find something more peaceful. Instead, see if you
can remember that the intention is not to strive for some goal, not
even to be relaxed or to find peace of mind. Pleasant feelings, if they
arise in some moments, are a welcome by-product of the practice, but
they are by no means "the" goal of the practice. If there is any "goal," it
is merely that of being fully present with openhearted spaciousness
with whatever arises in experience, to be awake, to be fully alive, to be
fully who we already are at our core.
There is no question that effort is required in the practice of medi­
tation, but it is the wise effort of patience, commitment, and trust
rather than the effort of continually checking to see how much "prog­
ress" you've made toward what you think is your "destination. " It is

RECLA I M I N G YOUR L I FE

230

rather like hoping that a butterfly will settle on your shoulder. Trying
to make it do so and getting more and more agitated if it doesn't only
makes it less likely to happen. In the end, you j ust have to give up try­
ing and see if the butterfly lands by itself.
It is wise to put time aside on a daily basis for the more formal cul­
tivation of mindfulness using the various practices described in the
book. Try to view this time as a special time for yourself, and so protect
and respect it accordingly. It is not selfish to take such time for our­
selves. On the contrary, it is an act of wisdom and self-compassion to
take such time for dropping in on the present moment, whatever we
find here. Dedicating a specific place and a particular time in which to
practice may mean rearranging your life a bit. Few of us have a spare
hour in each day that is not already accounted for by family or work
commitments-or sleep. So, for eight weeks, some of these commit­
ments may have to be modified or rearranged. It can be challenging in
some ways to do this, even for two months, but it's essential to make
such a commitment and then stick with it through thick and thin, as
part of the discipline inherent in mindfulness. Otherwise, our worthy
intention to practice will inevitably get squeezed out by other, seem­
ingly higher, priorities. The doing mind will always be more than
happy to present a compelling case for not practicing "today" or for
cutting corners on our commitment. You may find it most effective to
wake up earlier in the morning and devote that time to formal practice.
If so, perhaps you will need to go to bed earlier so that your practice is
not done entirely at the expense of needed sleep. When you have set­
tled on a time and a place, it is best to make arrangements so that you
will be warm and comfortable, telling whoever needs to know what you
are up to so that you will not be disturbed or interrupted. If the tele­
phone does ring during the time you have set aside for practicing and
there is no one else who might answer it, see if it is possible to let it
ring, being "out" for whoever is calling and "in" for yourself. That
alone is a powerful and nurturing practice, especially in this era of cell
phones and 24/7 connectivity. We can look at this time as a time to
connect with ourselves for a change, an increasingly rare event for all
of us.

Bringing It All Together

23 1

While we occasionally have to deal with external interruptions of
our practice, it is the internal "interruptions" that are the most chal­
lenging. For indeed, we are continually interrupting ourselves. This be­
comes very apparent when we begin to observe the activity of our own
minds as we attempt to maintain a particular focus of attention. Those
interruptions can take many different forms, such as the wandering
mind, the wanting mind, the j udging mind, the planning mind, the
worrying mind, and the obsessing, ruminating mind. We will be con­
stantly visited by thoughts of things we j ust remembered we need to do
and the accompanying feeling of having to "act right now. " If this hap­
pens, see if you can experiment with letting all these ideas and plans,
j udgments, and self-talk come and go in your mind like clouds in the
sky, rather than reacting to them as if you had to go and do whatever it
is right now. And let's refrain as best we can from turning the medita­
tion practice into one more "thing" we now have to do. For it is not a
doing, it is simply being, and being yourself.
When we are guiding groups of patients through an eight-week
mindfulness program, we find it essential, before each session, to re­
mind ourselves of our own intentions and larger "agenda" for that ses­
sion. In the same spirit, we recommend that you begin each week by
reviewing the relevant chapters of this book. To help you do this, we
highlight them at the beginning of the suggested program outlined
here for each of the eight weeks. That would be a good time to incor­
porate the additional exercises described in each chapter, if you have
not already done so.
Last, it is important to remember that you don't have to find the
practice enj oyable. In fact, you don't have to like it at all. The chal­
lenge is j ust to take it on for eight weeks, following the instructions in
as wholehearted a way as you can manage, suspending j udgment along
the way. As best you can, let go of all agendas, even to get better, and
see what happens, moment by moment, day by day, and week by week.
Keep to the practices day by day with the intention that this discipline,
this radical act of being with yourself, of taking time for yourself, will
become an intimate part of your life, part of your daily routine, but
without ever becoming routine. The invitation is to always be opening

to the new, because each moment is new, and unique, and available
to us.
On this adventure of dropping in on ourselves and recognizing
how fully alive we are or can be, you are responsible only for what you
bring to the practice, the input. The output, or outcome, is predictable
in some ways, and in other ways it is completely unpredictable. Any
outcomes will be unique for each of us and continually changing any­
way. None of us can tell in advance what is to be discovered in some
future present moment. All we get to work with is now. If we can be
here for this moment of now, with things exactly as they already are,
that is the practice. The rest takes care of itself.
The second most important thing to remember is to practice every
day even if, on some days, it might be for only five minutes. The most
important thing is to remember that the real practice is none other
than your life.

WEEK 1 ( C HAPTERS 3 AND 5 )

For the first week of your formal practice, we recommend that you do
the body scan, using the instructions on Track 2 on the CD that accom­
panies this book. Do it every day, whether you feel like it or not. You
will have to experiment with what the best time of day is for you to
practice, but remember, the idea is to "fall awake," not to fall asleep. If
you have a lot of trouble with sleepiness, try practicing with your eyes
open.
To cultivate mindfulness in your daily life-what we have been
calling "informal practice"-you might try bringing moment-to­
moment awareness to routine activities such as brushing your teeth,
showering, drying your body, getting dressed, eating, driving, or taking
out the garbage. The list of possibilities is endless, but the point is sim­
ply to zero-in on knowing what you are doing as you are actually doing it
and on what you are thinking and feeling from moment to moment as
well. You may find it helpful j ust to pick out one routine activity each

Bringing It All Together

233

week, such as brushing your teeth, and see if you can remember to be
fully with the activity when you do it, every time you do it, as best you
can. Of course, this is not so easy, so forgetting and then remembering
again also becomes an important part of this practice. In addition, you
might try to eat at least one meal during the week mindfully.

WEEK 2 ( C HAPTER 4 )

Continue practicing the body scan each day, guided by the instructions
on the CD. You may find it helpful to remember that the body scan is a
foundational practice, the virtues of which may not be apparent for
some time. In addition to the body scan, practice mindfulness of breath­

ing while sitting for ten minutes (Track 4 on the CD) at some other
time during the day.
For informal practice in Week 2 , we suggest you extend your
mindfulness of everyday activities by adding a new routine activity that
you carry out each day, and make a particular point of being present
and attentive for this activity, as well as the one you chose for Week 1 .
I t would also be a good idea to try to be aware of one pleasant event per
day in your life as it is happening. Keep a calendar for the week, j otting
down what the experience was, whether you were actually aware of it
at the time it was happening ( that's the assignment, but it doesn't al­
ways work out that way ) , how your body felt at the time, what thoughts
and feelings were present, and what thoughts pass through your mind
at the time you are writing it down. A sample calendar is provided on
pages 235-236.

WEEK 3 ( C HAPTERS 6 AND 9 )

We recommend that in Week 3 you stop doing the body scan for a
while and replace it with longer daily sittings, each preceded by ten
minutes of gentle, mindful yoga. You may find that the simplest way to

do his is, first, to make sure that the place you sit will be ready and
then go right through the instructions on CD Tracks 3 (mindful stand­

ing yoga ) , 4 (mindfulness of the breath ) , and 5 (mindfulness of the breath
and body ) . If you wish to explore the mindful yoga more deeply as part
of your practice, you can find two 45-minute guided mindful yoga
sequences that we use in our MBSR and MBCT programs as part of
the Series 1 Guided Mindfulness Meditation Practice Programs with
Jon Kabat-Zinn, obtainable on the Web from www. mindfulnesscds . com.
The mindful yoga used as part of the MBCT classes in Oxford are avail­
able as part of the set of five CDs of mindfulness practice with Mark
Williams, obtainable through the Oxford Cognitive Therapy Centre

( www. octc . co . uk). Remember to do in the yoga only what you feel your
body is capable of and always to err on the side of being conservative,
listening carefully to your body's messages as you practice. Remember
also to check with your doctor or physical therapist if you have chronic
pain, any kind of musculoskeletal problem, or lung or heart disease.
Week 3 is a good time to begin practicing the three-minute breath­
ing space ( Chapter 9 ) . We suggest you begin by doing it three times a
day at set times that you have decided on in advance. Use the instruc­
tions on the CD (Track 7 ) for guidance until you get the hang of it and
then practice giving yourself the instructions in the same way.
For informal practice in Week 3 , try to be aware, in detail, of your
experience of one unpleasant or stressful event each day. Observe and re­
cord these unpleasant events in j ust the same way that you did with
the pleasant events in Week 2. A sample calendar is provided on pages
238-239.

WEEK 4 ( C HAPTERS 6 AND 7)

For daily formal practice in Week 4, we suggest that you continue with
the sequence of mindful yoga (CD Track 3 ) , mindfulness of the breath
(Track 4 ) , and mindfulness of the breath and body (Track 5 ) . This week,
see if you can use this practice as a time to tune in especially to feelings
of pleasantness and unpleasantness ( Chapter 6) from moment to mo-

RECLAIMING YOUR LIFE

ment. If you become aware of any experiences that are particularly in­
tense or unpleasant, or of any strong feelings of aversion or disliking
while you are practicing, you might try using these as opportunities to
experiment with responding more skillfully and gently to what is diffi­
cult and unwanted as opposed to merely reacting.
Continue to take a breathing space three times every day, at regular
times that you have scheduled in advance. In addition, you might like
to begin to experiment with intentionally responding to the unpleas­
ant and stressful events in your day-to-day life. Do this by taking a
three-minute breathing space whenever you become aware that you are
having difficulty remaining present, feel unhappy, stressed, or thrown
off balance.

WEEK 5 ( C HAPTER 7 )

I n Week 5 we suspend the mindful yoga, although, of course, you can
always continue it if you care to. However, the primary focus of the for­
mal practice this week is becoming more aware of aversion and culti­
vating gentle ways of responding to unpleasant feelings with greater al­
lowing and acceptance. We recommend that, every day, you practice

mindfulness of the breath , and of the breath and body, using the instruc­
tions on Tracks 4 and 5 of the CD, and then turn off the CD and con­
tinue by deliberately bringing a difficulty or concern to mind. Using
the suggestions given in Chapter 7, explore and experiment with ways
of responding more gently and kindly to unpleasant feelings and body
sensations. Throughout these explorations, be sure to take good care of
yourself, using the guidelines in Chapter 7. After being with a difficulty
or concern for five minutes or so in this way, you may find it helpful to
conclude your daily sitting with a three-minute breathing space (CD
Track 7 ) .
As in Week 4 , continue to do a three-minute breathing space three
times a day at your regular scheduled times and also whenever you be­
come aware of unpleasant feelings. This week you might like to explore
the option of Opening the Body Door (Chapter 9 ) .

Bringing It All Together

24 1

WEEK 6 ( C HAPTER 8 )

In Week 6, the focus is on thinking. For your daily formal practice we
recommend running through the sequence of CD Tracks 4 (mindfulness
of the breath) , 5 (mindfulness of breath and body ) , and 6 (mindfulness of
sounds and thoughts ) . Toward the end of the instructions on Track 6
(mindfulness of sounds and thoughts ) , you will find instructions for culti­
vating choiceless awareness . We suggest that you shut off the CD after
this track and continue on your own in silence for a period of time, us­
ing the instructions at the end of that track and also the instructions
outlined in Chapter 9. Then you might find it useful to finish off with a
three minute breathing space (Track 7 ) .
Continue to use the breathing space three times a day at previously
scheduled times and whenever you experience unpleasant feelings.
This week you might like to focus particularly on the thoughts that are
present in those moments in which you experience unpleasant feelings.
One way to do this is to follow the exercise we call Opening the
Thought Door ( Chapter 9 ) .
By this time you will probably want to b e making the decisions for
yourself about when and what to practice and for how long. After four
or five weeks, many people feel ready to start crafting and personalizing
their own meditation practice more and more, using our guidelines
merely as suggestions. By the end of the eight weeks our aim is for you
to have made the practice your own by adapting it to suit your sched­
ule, your needs, and your temperament in terms of which combination
of formal and informal techniques you find most helpful.

WEEK 7 ( C HAPTERS 3 AND 9 )

To encourage self-directed practice, alternate days this week are dedi­
cated to practicing without the CD, if at all possible. We recommend
that, on these days, you devote a total of forty minutes per day to a
combination of sitting, mindful yoga, and the body scan, deciding on
the mix yourself. We encourage you to experiment, perhaps using two

242

RECLA I M IN G YOUR LIFE

or even three of the practices on the same day. On one day you might
do the yoga for ten minutes, followed by twenty minutes of sitting
meditation right after it, with perhaps a ten-minute body scan at an­
other time of day entirely. On another day, having spent ten minutes
practicing mindfulness of the breath, you might continue sitting with
choiceless awareness for the rest of the forty minutes.
On the alternate days, we recommend using the suggestions for

formal practice given for Week 6 (CD Tracks 4, 5 , and 6 ) , followed by
continuing with optional choiceless awareness, or j ust returning to an
awareness of the breath.
At this point, you may find it helpful to reflect on your practice
of the three-minute breathing space by rereading Chapter 9. Con­
tinue with the regular, scheduled, breathing spaces three times a day.
When responding to unpleasant events with a breathing space, focus this
week on the option of Opening the Door of Skillful Action ( Chapter 9 ) .

WEEK 8 ( C HAPTER 1 0 )

Week 8 in the program is the time to decide what, for you, will be the
pattern of daily mindfulness practice that you will settle into for the fu­
ture if you decide that the practice of mindfulness is valuable enough
for you to keep nurturing it. This is a good time to revisit all the formal
practices, including the body scan, by working your way through
Tracks 1 through 7 of the CD in whatever order and combination you
choose. The pattern of practice that you finally choose might, of
course, be based on taking yourself through one or more of these prac­
tices without using any guidance at all. In our experience, almost with­
out exception, people have found it invaluable to include the breath­
ing space as part of their daily practice. In Chapter 10 ( "Everyday
Mindfulness" box) you will find more suggestions for how to keep up
the momentum of mindfulness practice and deepen it over the years.
The eighth week is the end of our formal recommendations for
practice, but it also marks the first week of practicing entirely on your
own. We tell our patients that the eighth week really represents the

Bringing It All Together

243

rest of your life. It is a new beginning as much as it is a noteworthy
completion, not really an end of anything. Life keeps unfolding, the
breath keeps unfolding, our moments keep unfolding. The practice
doesn't end j ust because we have reached this point in our journey to­
gether. By now you will be firmly in the driver's seat yourself in one
manner of speaking and probably feeling like an utter novice at the
same time, left to your own devices far too prematurely. This is a totally
natural feeling. It is also based on reality, as the practice of mindfulness
is really endless, as is the potential for each of us to grow into ourselves.
But if, up to this point, you have been able to practice in a regular, dis­
ciplined way, as we have been encouraging you to do, chances are you
will have tasted enough of the abundance of the present moment to
want to continue to inhabit your life in a way that honors being and
lets whatever doing we engage in, inwardly and outwardly, to flow out
of our being. By this point, whether the thinking, j udging mind be­
lieves it or not, you will have developed enough skill and experience to
keep up the momentum you have generated through your own efforts
over these eight weeks. And this momentum, coupled with the inher­
ent wisdom of your own heart, will continue to guide and shape the
deepening of your own mindfulness practice and help you to embrace
fully, through thick and thin, this ongoing adventure we call life.
All contemporary meditation teachers, ourselves included, en­
courage students to carve out time from their busy lives to do some
kind of formal meditation practice every day, such as sitting quietly,
aware of the breath breathing itself. It does not matter how long we
give to the practice; that we make the attempt to pause within all the
doing and moving forward and practice, however brief it is by the
clock, on a daily basis. Ultimately, mindfulness is not about time; it is
about now. So even brief moments by the clock, if we are really present
for them with awareness, in being mode, are profoundly reorienting
and healing. However, to really know the landscape of our own mind
and body, it is important to visit on a regular basis, or perhaps take up
permanent residency, so to speak, rather than being a perpetual tourist.
It may even be important, sooner or later, to learn the language . As
with gaining fluency in a foreign language, living immersed in it and

RECLAIMING YOUR L I FE

244

making use of it over and over again become extremely important. Flu­
ency is kept alive through regular practice.
If you cultivate mindfulness on a regular basis, you almost can't
help discovering that your mind has deep inner resources you hardly
knew existed. Or even if you suspected as much, you probably didn't
know that they could be systematically accessed from the depths of
your own mind and heart and body and put to wise use for both your
own benefit and the well-being of others. You may find yourself sud­
denly surprised to discover life situations in which a fresh and clearer
perspective on things arises spontaneously and unbidden. You may be
astonished when it takes the form of a spaciousness in your heart and
mind that carries with it a sense of being free-free to be in wiser rela­
tionship to whatever is unfolding and also to be able to let go when ap­
propriate and move on in ways that had before seemed impossible,
even inconceivable. You are discovering an inner wisdom within your­
self, a wisdom that can transform your emotions and your life. Once
you have tasted this for yourself and seen the possibility of drinking
even more deeply at this well, nothing can ever be quite the same
again.

and Retreat Centers

In this section we give some guidance on how you may continue to
deepen the work that you have started in following this book. We be­
gin with some suggestions for further reading.
Jon Kabat-Zinn's book Full Catastrophe Living describes in detail
the University of Massachusetts Medical Center's Mindfulness-Based
Stress Reduction program and is an excellent introduction to mindful­
ness training. Jon is also the author of Wherever You Go , There You Are,
a book that explores how to bring mindfulness into everyday life. It in­
cludes a wide range of suggestions for formal and informal practice. His
most recent book, Coming to Our Senses, weaves detailed suggestions
for practice into a larger tapestry that focuses on the senses { including
awareness itself as a sense} as profound and nonconceptual ways of
knowing that can powerfully complement our thoughts and emotions
and bring them into greater balance. It explores a range of practical
ways to bring mindfulness into our lives, as well as how we might ex­
pand not only our vision but also our sense of self and allow it to nour­
ish our capacity for compassion, wisdom, and healing. If you are inter­
ested in the unique challenges of raising children, and the possibilities
for approaching parenting itself as a form of intensive mindfulness
practice while j uggling all your other responsibilities and callings, you
may want to consult Everyday Blessings, a book about mindful parent­
ing written by Jon and his wife, Myla Kabat-Zinn.

Further Reading, Web Materials, and Retreat Centers
Finally, if you are a therapist or counselor and wish to see how

mindfulness might inform your approach for dealing with depression,
then it would be useful to read Mindfulness�Based Cognitive Therapy for

Depression: A New Approach to Preventing Relapse (Zindel Segal, Mark
Williams, and John Teasdale; Guilford Press, 2002 ) .
You may also find i t valuable to visit the website of the Center
for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care, and Society at the Uni�
versity of Massachusetts Medical Center (www. umassmed. edu/cfm ) ,
where MBSR originated, and the website o f the Centre for Mindful�
ness Research and Practice at the University of Wales, Bangor, UK

(www. bangor.ac . uk/mindfulness) and to stay in touch with develop�
ments by visiting www.mbct. co . uk or www. mbct. com.
If you decide you would like to pursue the practice of mindfulness
even further, it is usually very important to study directly with experi�
enced meditation teachers and have direct face�to�face time with them
(places to start are detailed below ) . However, you might first find it
valuable to begin by pursuing a range of options for growing your prac�
tice on your own, using audiotapes or CDs that have been developed
precisely for the purpose of home practice. As noted earlier, the re�
sources that we use in our mindfulness programs can be good for this
purpose and can provide an expanded perspective on your own medita�
tion practice: These are the three series of four CDs each of guided
mindfulness meditation practices recorded by Jon Kabat�Zinn and de�
scribed in detail on the website www.mindfulnesscds . com. Series 3 in�
eludes extended guided meditations on choiceless awareness and lov�
ing kindness.
In addition, if you want to sample the practices as they are used in
the Oxford MBCT program by Mark Williams ( see www.mbcuo . uk ) , a
set of five CDs is available, and you can contact the Oxford Cognitive
Therapy Centre, Wameford Hospital, Oxford, UK ( www. octc . co . uk)
and follow the links to Mindfulness. As we have j ust noted, it can be
very helpful to deepen one's meditation practice through direct expo�
sure to experienced meditation teachers. Be aware that there are many
different forms of meditation. If you'd like to further pursue the ap�
proach we have been exploring in this book, you may wish to choose a

About the Au thors

Dr. Teasdale's research has investigated basic psychological processes
and the application of that understanding to the development of thera­
pies for emotional disorders. For many years, this research involved the
exploration of cognitive approaches to understanding and treating ma­
j or depression, and he was one of the pioneers of cognitive therapy re­
search in the United Kingdom. More recently, the findings of his ear­
lier research have been applied to the development and evaluation of
mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. Currently retired, Dr. Teasdale
continues to pursue interests in the practice, study, and teaching of
meditation and mindfulness training.

Cognitive Therapy, Cognitive Vulnerability to Depression, and Mindfulness­
Based Cognitive Therapy for Depression : A New Approach to Preventing
